    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The time was the year 1872, and the place a bend in the river above a long
      pond terminating in a dam. Beyond this dam, and on a flat lower than it,
      stood a two-story mill structure. Save for a small, stump-dotted clearing,
      and the road that led from it, all else was forest. Here in the
      bottom-lands, following the course of the stream, the hardwoods grew
      dense, their uppermost branches just beginning to spray out in the first
      green of spring. Farther back, where the higher lands arose from the
      swamp, could be discerned the graceful frond of white pines and hemlock,
      and the sturdy tops of Norways and spruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong wind blew up the length of the pond. It ruffled the surface of
      the water, swooping down in fan-shaped, scurrying cat's-paws, turning the
      dark-blue surface as one turns the nap of velvet. At the upper end of the
      pond it even succeeded in raising quite respectable wavelets, which LAP
      LAP LAPPED eagerly against a barrier of floating logs that filled
      completely the mouth of the inlet river. And behind this barrier were
      other logs, and yet others, as far as the eye could see, so that the
      entire surface of the stream was carpeted by the brown timbers. A man
      could have walked down the middle of that river as down a highway.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the bank, and in a small woods-opening, burned two fires, their smoke
      ducking and twisting under the buffeting of the wind. The first of these
      fires occupied a shallow trench dug for its accommodation, and was
      overarched by a rustic framework from which hung several pails, kettles,
      and pots. An injured-looking, chubby man in a battered brown derby hat
      moved here and there. He divided his time between the utensils and an
      indifferent youth&mdash;his &ldquo;cookee.&rdquo; The other, and larger, fire centred
      a rectangle composed of tall racks, built of saplings and intended for the
      drying of clothes. Two large tents gleamed white among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the drying-fire were gathered thirty-odd men. Some were
      half-reclining before the blaze; others sat in rows on logs drawn close
      for the purpose; still others squatted like Indians on their heels, their
      hands thrown forward to keep the balance. Nearly all were smoking pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every age was represented in this group, but young men predominated. All
      wore woollen trousers stuffed into leather boots reaching just to the
      knee. These boots were armed on the soles with rows of formidable sharp
      spikes or caulks, a half and sometimes even three quarters of an inch in
      length. The tight driver's shoe and &ldquo;stagged&rdquo; trousers had not then come
      into use. From the waist down these men wore all alike, as though in a
      uniform, the outward symbol of their calling. From the waist up was more
      latitude of personal taste. One young fellow sported a bright-coloured
      Mackinaw blanket jacket; another wore a red knit sash, with tasselled
      ends; a third's fancy ran to a bright bandana about his neck. Head-gear,
      too, covered wide variations of broader or narrower brim, of higher or
      lower crown; and the faces beneath those hats differed as everywhere the
      human countenance differs. Only when the inspection, passing the
      gradations of broad or narrow, thick or thin, bony or rounded, rested
      finally on the eyes, would the observer have caught again the caste-mark
      which stamped these men as belonging to a distinct order, and separated
      them essentially from other men in other occupations. Blue and brown and
      black and gray these eyes were, but all steady and clear with the
      steadiness and clarity that comes to those whose daily work compels them
      under penalty to pay close and undeviating attention to their
      surroundings. This is true of sailors, hunters, plainsmen, cowboys, and
      tugboat captains. It was especially true of the old-fashioned
      river-driver, for a misstep, a miscalculation, a moment's forgetfulness of
      the sullen forces shifting and changing about him could mean for him
      maiming or destruction. So, finally, to one of an imaginative bent, these
      eyes, like the &ldquo;cork boots,&rdquo; grew to seem part of the uniform, one of the
      marks of their caste, the outward symbol of their calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow, you son of a gun!&rdquo; cried disgustedly one young fellow with a red
      bandana, apostrophising the wind. &ldquo;I wonder if there's ANY side of this
      fire that ain't smoky!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your hair on, bub,&rdquo; advised a calm and grizzled old-timer. &ldquo;There's
      never no smoke on the OTHER side of the fire&mdash;whichever that happens
      to be. And as for wind&mdash;she just makes holiday for the river-hogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holiday, hell!&rdquo; snorted the younger man. &ldquo;We ought to be down to Bull's
      Dam before now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bull's Dam is half-way to Redding,&rdquo; mocked a reptilian and red-headed
      giant on the log, &ldquo;and Redding is the happy childhood home of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man leaped to his feet and seized from a pile of tools a peavy&mdash;a
      dangerous weapon, like a heavy cant-hook, but armed at the end with a
      sharp steel shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about enough!&rdquo; he warned, raising his weapon, his face suffused
      and angry. The red-headed man, quite unafraid, rose slowly from the log
      and advanced, bare-handed, his small eyes narrowed and watchful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But immediately a dozen men interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dry up!&rdquo; advised the grizzled old-timer&mdash;Tom North by name. &ldquo;You,
      Purdy, set down; and you, young squirt, subside! If you're going to have
      ructions, why, have 'em, but not on drive. If you don't look out, I'll set
      you both to rustling wood for the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this threat the belligerents dropped muttering to their places. The
      wind continued to blow, the fire continued to flare up and down, the men
      continued to smoke, exchanging from time to time desultory and aimless
      remarks. Only Tom North carried on a consecutive, low-voiced conversation
      with another of about his own age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same, Jim,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;it is a little tough on the boys&mdash;this
      new sluice-gate business. They've been sort of expectin' a chance for a
      day or two at Redding, and now, if this son of a gun of a wind hangs out,
      I don't know when we'll make her. The shallows at Bull's was always bad
      enough, but this is worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I expected to pick you up 'way below,&rdquo; admitted Jim, whose &ldquo;turkey,&rdquo;
       or clothes-bag, at his side proclaimed him a newcomer. &ldquo;Had quite a tramp
      to find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This stretch of slack water was always a terror,&rdquo; went on North, &ldquo;and we
      had fairly to pike-pole every stick through when the wind blew; but now
      that dam's backed the water up until there reely ain't no current at all.
      And this breeze has just stopped the drive dead as a smelt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't opening the sluice-gates give her a draw?&rdquo; inquired the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not against this wind&mdash;and not much of a draw, anyway, I should
      guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long you been hung?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to-day. I expect Jack will be down from the rear shortly. Ought to
      see something's wrong when he runs against the tail of this jam of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the lugubrious, round-faced man in the derby hat stepped
      aside from the row of steaming utensils he had been arranging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grub pile,&rdquo; he remarked in a conversational tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group arose as one man and moved upon the heap of cutlery and of tin
      plates and cups. From the open fifty-pound lard pails and kettles they
      helped themselves liberally; then retired to squat in little groups here
      and there near the sources of supply. Mere conversation yielded to an
      industrious silence. Sadly the cook surveyed the scene, his arms folded
      across the dirty white apron, an immense mental reservation accenting the
      melancholy of his countenance. After some moments of contemplation he
      mixed a fizzling concoction of vinegar and soda, which he drank. His
      rotundity to the contrary notwithstanding, he was ravaged by a gnawing
      dyspepsia, and the sight of six eggs eaten as a side dish to substantials
      carried consternation to his interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      So busily engaged was each after his own fashion that nobody observed the
      approach of a solitary figure down the highway of the river. The man
      appeared tiny around the upper bend, momently growing larger as he
      approached. His progress was jerky and on an uneven zigzag, according as
      the logs lay, by leaps, short runs, brief pauses, as a riverman goes.
      Finally he stepped ashore just below the camp, stamped his feet vigorously
      free of water, and approached the group around the cooking-fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one saw him save the cook, who vouchsafed him a stately and lugubrious
      inclination of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newcomer was a man somewhere about thirty years of age, squarely
      built, big of bone, compact in bulk. His face was burly, jolly, and
      reddened rather than tanned by long exposure. A pair of twinkling blue
      eyes and a humorously quirked mouth redeemed his countenance from
      commonplaceness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spread his feet apart and surveyed the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; he remarked at last in a rollicking big voice, &ldquo;I'm glad to
      see the situation hasn't spoiled your appetites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this they looked up with a spontaneous answering grin. Tom North laid
      aside his plate and started to arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit still, Tom,&rdquo; interposed the newcomer. &ldquo;Eat hearty. I'm going to feed
      yet myself. Then we'll see what's to be done. I think first thing you'd
      better see to having this wind turned off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the meal was finished, North and his principal sauntered to the
      water's edge, where they stood for a minute looking at the logs and the
      ruffled expanse of water below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might as well have sails on them and be done with it,&rdquo; remarked Jack Orde
      reflectively. &ldquo;Couldn't hold 'em any tighter. It's a pity that old
      mossback had to put in a mill. The water was slack enough before, but now
      there seems to be no current at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Case of wait for the wind,&rdquo; agreed Tom North. &ldquo;Old Daly will be
      red-headed. He must be about out of logs at the mill. The flood-water's
      going down every minute, and it'll make the riffles above Redding a holy
      fright. And I expect Johnson's drive will be down on our rear most any
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's there already. Let's go take a look,&rdquo; suggested Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      They picked their way around the edge of the pond to the site of the new
      mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sluice open all right,&rdquo; commented Orde. &ldquo;Thought she might be closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw to that,&rdquo; rejoined North in an injured tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Course,&rdquo; agreed Orde, &ldquo;but he might have dropped her shut on you between
      times, when you weren't looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked out on the structure and looked down on the smooth water rushing
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought to make a draw,&rdquo; he reflected. Then he laughed. &ldquo;Tom, look here,&rdquo;
       he called. &ldquo;Climb down and take a squint at this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      North clambered to a position below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The son of a gun!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sluice, instead of bedding at the natural channel of the river, had
      been built a good six feet above that level; so that, even with the gates
      wide open, a &ldquo;head&rdquo; of six feet was retained in the slack water of the
      pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder we couldn't get a draw,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;Let's hunt up old
      What's-his-name and have a pow-wow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is plain Reed,&rdquo; explained North. &ldquo;There he comes now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sainted cats!&rdquo; cried Orde, with one of his big, rollicking chuckles.
      &ldquo;Where did you catch it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the dam flapped into view as a lank and lengthy individual
      dressed in loose, long clothes and wearing a-top a battered old &ldquo;plug&rdquo;
       hat, the nap of which seemed all to have been rubbed off the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he bore down on the intruders with tremendous, nervous strides, they
      perceived him to be an old man, white of hair, cadaverous of countenance,
      with thin, straight lips, and burning, fanatic eyes beneath stiff and
      bushy brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Reed,&rdquo; shouted Orde above the noise of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; replied the apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice dam you got here,&rdquo; went on Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reed nodded, his fiery eyes fixed unblinking on the riverman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't been quite square to us,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;You aren't giving
      us much show to get our logs out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; snapped the owner, his thin lips tightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess you know, all right,&rdquo; laughed Orde, clambering leisurely back
      to the top of the dam. &ldquo;That sluice is a good six foot too high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so!&rdquo; cried the old man, plunging suddenly into a craze of
      excitement. &ldquo;Well, let me tell you this, Mr. Man, I'm giving you all the
      law gives you, and that's the natural flow of the river, and not a thing
      more will you get! You that comes to waste and destroy, to arrogate unto
      yourselves the kingdoms of the yearth and all the fruits thereof, let me
      tell you you can't override Simeon Reed! I'm engaged here in a peaceful
      and fittin' operation, which is to feed the hungry by means of this
      grist-mill, not to rampage and bring destruction to the noble forests God
      has planted! I've give you what the law gives you, and nothin' more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat astonished at this outbreak, the two rivermen stood for a moment
      staring at the old man. Then a steely glint crept into Orde's frank blue
      eye and the corners of his mouth tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want no trouble with you, Mr. Reed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I'm no lawyer to
      know what the law requires you to do and what it requires you not to do.
      But I do know that this is the only dam on the river with sluices built up
      that way, and I do know that we'll never get those logs out if we don't
      get more draw on the water. Good-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Followed by the reluctant North he walked away, leaving the gaunt figure
      of the dam owner gazing after them, his black garments flapping about him,
      his hands clasped behind his back, his ruffled plug hat thrust from his
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; burst out North, when they were out of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; mimicked Orde with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to let that old high-banker walk all over you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do about it, Tom? It's his dam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. But you ain't going to let him bang us up here all summer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure not. But the wind's shifting. Let's see what the weather's like
      to-morrow. To-day's pretty late.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning dawned clear and breathless. Before daylight the
      pessimistic cook was out, his fire winking bravely against the darkness.
      His only satisfaction of the long day came when he aroused the men from
      the heavy sleep into which daily toil plunged them. With the first light
      the entire crew were at the banks of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the wind died the logs had begun to drift slowly out into the
      open water. The surface of the pond was covered with the scattered timbers
      floating idly. After a few moments the clank of the bars and ratchet was
      heard as two of the men raised the heavy sluice-gate on the dam. A roar of
      water, momently increasing, marked the slow rise of the barrier. A very
      imaginative man might then have made out a tendency forward on the part of
      those timbers floating nearest the centre of the pond. It was a very
      sluggish tendency, however, and the men watching critically shook their
      heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four more had by this time joined the two men who had raised the gate, and
      all together, armed with long pike poles, walked out on the funnel-shaped
      booms that should concentrate the logs into the chute. Here they prodded
      forward the few timbers within reach, and waited for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were a long time coming. Members of the driving crew leaped shouting
      from one log to another. Sometimes, when the space across was too wide to
      jump, they propelled a log over either by rolling it, paddling it, or
      projecting it by the shock of a leap on one end. In accomplishing these
      feats of tight-rope balance, they stood upright and graceful, quite
      unconscious of themselves, their bodies accustomed by long habit to nice
      and instant obedience to the almost unconscious impulses of the brain.
      Only their eyes, intent, preoccupied, blazed out by sheer will-power the
      unstable path their owners should follow. Once at the forefront of the
      drive, the men began vigorously to urge the logs forward. This they
      accomplished almost entirely by main strength, for the sluggish current
      gave them little aid. Under the pressure of their feet as they pushed
      against their implements, the logs dipped, rolled, and plunged.
      Nevertheless, they worked as surely from the decks of these unstable craft
      as from the solid earth itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner the logs in the centre of the pond were urged forward
      until, above the chute, they caught the slightly accelerated current which
      should bring them down to the pike-pole men at the dam. Immediately, when
      this stronger influence was felt, the drivers zigzagged back up stream to
      start a fresh batch. In the meantime a great many logs drifted away to
      right and left into stagnant water, where they lay absolutely motionless.
      The moving of them was deferred for the &ldquo;sacking crew,&rdquo; which would bring
      up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Orde wandered back and forth over the work, his hands clasped behind
      his back, a short pipe clenched between his teeth. To the edge of the
      drive he rode the logs, then took to the bank and strolled down to the
      dam. There he stood for a moment gazing aimlessly at the water making over
      the apron, after which he returned to the work. No cloud obscured the
      serene good-nature of his face. Meeting Tom North's troubled glance, he
      grinned broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told you we'd have Johnson on our necks,&rdquo; he remarked, jerking his thumb
      up river toward a rapidly approaching figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This soon defined itself as a tall, sun-reddened, very blond individual
      with a choleric blue eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in hell's the matter here?&rdquo; he yelled, as soon as he came within
      hearing distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde made no reply, but stood contemplating the newcomer with a flicker of
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in hell's the matter?&rdquo; repeated the latter violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better go there and inquire,&rdquo; rejoined Orde drolly. &ldquo;What ails you,
      Johnson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're right at your rear,&rdquo; cried the other, &ldquo;and you ain't even made a
      start gettin' through this dam! We'll lose the water next! Why in hell
      ain't you through and gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your shirt on,&rdquo; advised Orde. &ldquo;We're getting through as fast as we
      can. If you want these logs pushed any faster, come down and do it
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnson vouchsafed no reply, but splashed away over the logs, examining in
      detail the progress of the work. After a little he returned within hailing
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can't get out logs, why do you take the job?&rdquo; he roared, with a
      string of oaths. &ldquo;If you hang my drive, damn you, you'll catch it for
      damages! It's gettin' to a purty pass when any old highbanker from
      anywheres can get out and play jackstraws holdin' up every drive in the
      river! I tell you our mills need logs, and what's more they're agoin' to
      GIT them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He departed in a rumble of vituperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde laughed humorously at his foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnson gets so mad sometimes, his skin cracks,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;However,&rdquo;
       he went on more seriously, &ldquo;there's a heap in what he means, if there
      ain't so much in what he says. I'll go labour with our old friend below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He regained the bank, stopped to light his pipe, and sauntered, with every
      appearance of leisure, down the bank, past the dam, to the mill structure
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he found the owner occupying a chair tilted back against the wall of
      the building. His ruffled plug hat was thrust, as usual, well away from
      his high and narrow forehead; the long broadcloth coat fell back to reveal
      an unbuttoned waistcoat the flapping black trousers were hitched up far
      enough to display woollen socks wrinkled about bony shanks. He was
      whittling a pine stick, which he held pointing down between his spread
      knees, and conversing animatedly with a young fellow occupying another
      chair at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there comes one of 'em now,&rdquo; declaimed the old man dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde nodded briefly to the stranger, and came at once to business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk this matter over with you,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;We aren't making
      much progress. We can't afford to hang up the drive, and the water is
      going down every day. We've got to have more water. I'll tell you what
      we'll do: If you'll let us cut down the new sill, we'll replace it in good
      shape when we get all our logs through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; promptly vetoed the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll give you something for the privilege. What do you think is
      fair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell ye I'll give you your legal rights, and not a cent more,&rdquo; replied
      the old man, still quietly, but with quivering nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Reed, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Reed, stop and think what this means. It's a more serious
      matter than you think. In a little while the water will be so low in the
      river that it will be impossible to take out the logs this year. That
      means a large loss, of course, as you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know nothin' about the pesky business, and I don't wan to,&rdquo;
       snorted Reed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's borers, for one thing, to spoil a good many of the logs.
      And think what it will mean to the mills. No logs means no lumber. That is
      bankruptcy for a good many who have contracts to fulfil. And no logs means
      the mills must close. Thousands of men will be thrown out of their jobs,
      and a good many of them will go hungry. And with the stream full of the
      old cutting, that means less to do next winter in the woods&mdash;more men
      thrown out. Getting out a season's cut with the flood-water is a pretty
      serious matter to a great many people, and if you insist on holding us up
      here in this slack water the situation will soon become alarming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye finished?&rdquo; demanded Reed grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man cast from him his half-whittled piece of pine. He closed his
      jack-knife with a snap and thrust it in his pocket. He brought to earth
      the front legs of his chair with a thump, and jammed his ruffled plug hat
      to its proper place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the whole kit and kaboodle of ye starved out-right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it
      would but be the fulfillin' of the word of the prophet who says, 'So will
      I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee, and
      pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword
      upon thee. I the Lord have spoken it!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's your last word?&rdquo; inquired Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my last word, and my first. Ye that make of God's smilin' land
      waste places and a wilderness, by your own folly shall ye perish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; said Orde, whirling on his heel without further argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, who had during this colloquy sat an interested and silent
      spectator, arose and joined him. Orde looked at his new companion a little
      curiously. He was a very slender young man, taut-muscled, taut-nerved, but
      impassive in demeanour. He possessed a shrewd, thin face, steel-gray,
      inscrutable eyes behind glasses. His costume was quite simply an old gray
      suit of business clothes and a gray felt hat. At the moment he held in his
      mouth an unlighted and badly chewed cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice, amiable old party,&rdquo; volunteered Orde with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to be,&rdquo; agreed the young man drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon we'll just have to worry along without him,&rdquo; remarked
      Orde, striking his steel caulks into the first log and preparing to cross
      out into the river where the work was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said the young fellow. &ldquo;Have you any objections to my
      hanging around a little to watch the work? My name is Newmark&mdash;Joseph
      Newmark. I'm out in this country a good deal for my health. This thing
      interests me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Orde, puzzled. &ldquo;Look all you want to. The scenery's free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But can you put me up? Can I get a chance to stay with you a little
      while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as far as I'm concerned,&rdquo; agreed Orde heartily. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he
      supplemented with one of his contagious chuckles, &ldquo;I'm only river-boss.
      You'll have to fix it up with the doctor&mdash;the cook, I mean,&rdquo; he
      explained, as Newmark look puzzled. &ldquo;You'll find him at camp up behind
      that brush. He's a slim, handsome fellow, with a jolly expression of
      countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaped lightly out over the bobbing timbers, leaving Newmark to find
      his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of the stream the work had been gradually slowing down to a
      standstill with the subsidence of the first rush of water after the
      sluice-gate was opened. Tom North, leaning gracefully against the shaft of
      a peavy, looked up eagerly as his principal approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jack,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;is it to be peace or war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War,&rdquo; replied Orde briefly.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      At this moment the cook stepped into view, and, making a trumpet of his
      two hands, sent across the water a long, weird, and not unmusical cry. The
      men at once began slowly to drift in the direction of the camp. There,
      when the tin plates had all been filled, and each had found a place to his
      liking, Orde addressed them. His manner was casual and conversational.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the old mossback who owns that dam has come up here
      loaded to scatter. He's built up the sill of that gate until we can't get
      a draw on the water, and he refuses to give, lend, or sell us the right to
      cut her out. I've made him every reasonable proposition, but all I get
      back is quotations from the prophets. Now, we've got to get those logs out&mdash;that's
      what we're here for. A fine bunch of whitewater birlers we'd look if we
      got hung up by an old mossback in a plug hat. Johnny Sims, what's the
      answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut her out,&rdquo; grinned Johnny Sims briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Correct!&rdquo; replied Orde with a chuckle. &ldquo;Cut her out. But, my son, it's
      against the law to interfere with another man's property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was so obviously humourous in intent that its only reception
      consisted of more grins from everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; went on Orde more seriously, &ldquo;it's quite a job. We can't work more
      than six or eight men at it at a time. We got to work as fast as we can
      before the old man can interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nearest sheriff's at Spruce Rapids,&rdquo; commented some one
      philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have sixty men, all told,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;We ought to be able to carry it
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He filled his plate and walked across to a vacant place. Here he found
      himself next to Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he greeted that young man, &ldquo;fixed it with the doctor all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Newmark, in his brief, dry manner, &ldquo;thanks! I think I ought
      to tell you that the sheriff is not at Spruce Rapids, but at the village&mdash;expecting
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde whistled, then broke into a roar of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;old Plug Hat's got the sheriff right handy. I guess he
      sort of expected we'd be thinking of cutting through that dam. How'd you
      like to go to jail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to see any sheriff take us to jail, unless he had an army with
      him,&rdquo; growled one of the river-jacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he a posse?&rdquo; inquired Orde of Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't see any; but I understood in the village that the governor had
      been advised to hold State troops in readiness for trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde fell into a brown study, eating mechanically. The men began an eager
      and somewhat truculent discussion full of lawless and bloodthirsty
      suggestion. Some suggested the kidnapping and sequestration of Reed until
      the affair should be finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'd he get hold of his old sheriff, then?&rdquo; they inquired with some
      pertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde, however, paid no attention to all this talk, but continued to frown
      into space. At last his face cleared, and he slapped down his tin plate so
      violently that the knife and fork jumped off into the dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he cried aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would not tell what he had. After the noon hour he instructed a
      half-dozen men to provide themselves with saws, axes, picks, and shovels,
      and all marched in the direction of the mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      When within a hundred yards or so of that structure the advancing riverman
      saw the lank, black figure of the mill owner flap into sight, astride a
      bony old horse, and clatter away, coat-tails flying, up the road and into
      the waiting forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys!&rdquo; cried Orde crisply. &ldquo;He'll be back in an hour with the
      sheriff. Lively!&rdquo; He rapidly designated ten men of his crew. &ldquo;You boys get
      to work and make things hum. Get as much done as you can before the
      sheriff comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll have to bring all of Spruce County to get me,&rdquo; commented one of
      those chosen, spitting on his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, too!&rdquo; said others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, listen,&rdquo; said Orde, holding them with an impressive gesture. &ldquo;When
      that sheriff comes, with or without a posse, I want you to go peaceably.
      Understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cave in? Not much!&rdquo; cried Purdy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; and Orde drew them aside to an earnest, low-voiced
      conversation that lasted several minutes. When he had finished he clapped
      each of them on the back, and all moved off, laughing, to the dam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; he commanded the others, &ldquo;no row without orders. Understand?
      If there's going to be a fight, I'll give you the word when.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chopping crew descended to the bottom of the sluice, the gate of which
      had been shut, and began immediately to chop away at the apron. As the
      water in the pond above had been drawn low by the morning's work, none
      overflowed the gate, so the men were enabled to work dry. Below the apron,
      of course, had been filled in with earth and stones. As soon as the
      axe-men had effected an entry to this deposit, other men with shovels and
      picks began to remove the filling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work had continued nearly an hour when Orde commanded the fifty or
      more idlers back to camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out, boys,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;The sheriff will be here pretty quick now,
      and I don't want any row. Get out of sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leave them to fight her out alone? Guess not!&rdquo; grumbled a tall, burly
      individual with a red face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde immediately walked directly to this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I bossing this drive, or am I not?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The riverman growled something.
    </p>
    <p>
      SMACK! SMACK! sounded Orde's fists. The man, taken by surprise, went down
      in a heap, but immediately rebounded to his feet as though made of rubber.
      But Orde had seized a peavy, and stood over against his antagonist, the
      murderous weapon upraised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie down, you hound, or I'll brain you!&rdquo; he roared at the top strength of
      his great voice. &ldquo;Want fight, do you? Well, you won't have to wait till
      the sheriff gets here! You make a move!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a full half minute the man crouched breathless, and Orde, his ruddy
      face congested, held his threatening attitude. Then he dropped his peavy
      and stepped aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;March!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Get your turkey and hit the hay trail. You'll get
      your time at Redding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man sullenly arose and slouched away, grumbling under his breath. Orde
      watched him from sight, then turned to the silent group, a new crispness
      in his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hesitating, they turned to the river trail, leaving the ten still working
      at the sluice. When well within the fringe of the brush, Orde called a
      halt. His customary good-humour seemed quite restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;squat down and lay low. You give me an ache!
      Don't you suppose I got this thing all figured out? If fight would do any
      good, you know mighty well I'd fight. And the boys won't be in jail any
      longer than it takes to get a wire to Daly to bail them out. Smoke up, and
      don't bother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They filled their pipes and settled down to an enjoyment of the situation.
      Ordinarily from very early in the morning until very late at night the
      riverman is busy every instant at his dangerous and absorbing work. Those
      affairs which do not immediately concern his task&mdash;as the swiftness
      of rapids, the state of flood, the curves of streams, the height of water,
      the obstructions of channels, the quantities of logs&mdash;pass by the
      outer fringe of his consciousness, if indeed they reach him at all. Thus,
      often he works all day up to his waist in a current bearing the rotten ice
      of the first break-up, or endures the drenching of an early spring rain,
      or battles the rigours of a belated snow with apparent indifference. You
      or I would be exceedingly uncomfortable; would require an effort of
      fortitude to make the plunge. Yet these men, absorbed in the mighty
      problems of their task, have little attention to spare to such things. The
      cold, the wet, the discomfort, the hunger, the weariness, all pass as
      shadows on the background. In like manner the softer moods of the spring
      rarely penetrate through the concentration of faculties on the work. The
      warm sun shines; the birds by thousands flutter and twitter and sing their
      way north; the delicate green of spring, showered from the hand of the
      passing Sower, sprinkles the tops of the trees, and gradually sifts down
      through the branches; the great, beautiful silver clouds sail down the
      horizon like ships of a statelier age, as totally without actual existence
      to these men. The logs, the river&mdash;those are enough to strain all the
      faculties a man possesses, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when, as now, a chance combination of circumstances brings them leisure
      to look about them, the forest and the world of out-of-doors comes to them
      with a freshness impossible for the city dweller to realise. The
      surroundings are accustomed, but they bring new messages. To most of them,
      these impressions never reach the point of coherency. They brood, and
      muse, and expand in the actual and figurative warmth, and proffer the
      general opinion that it is a damn fine day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Another full half hour elapsed before the situation developed further.
      Then Tom North's friend Jim, who had gathered his long figure on the top
      of a stump, unclasped his knees and remarked that old Plug Hat was back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men arose to their feet and peered cautiously through the brush. They
      saw Reed, accompanied by a thick-set man whom some recognised as the
      sheriff of the county, approach the edge of the dam. A moment later the
      working crew mounted to the top, stacked their tools neatly, resumed their
      coats and jackets, and departed up the road in convoy of the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gasp of astonishment broke from the concealed rivermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be damned!&rdquo; ejaculated one. &ldquo;What are we comin' to? That's the
      first time I ever see one lonesome sheriff gather in ten river-hogs
      without the aid of a gatlin' or an ambulance! What's the matter with that
      chicken-livered bunch, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde watched them, his eyes expressionless, until they had disappeared in
      the fringe of the forest Then he turned to the astonished group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and you, Ellis, and you, and you, and you, and you, get
      to work on that dam. And remember this, if you are arrested, go peaceably.
      Any resistance will spoil the whole game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men broke into mingled cheers and laughter as the full significance of
      Orde's plan reached them. They streamed back to the dam, where they
      perched proffering advice and encouragement to those about to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately, however, Reed was out, his eyes blazing either side his hawk
      nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;quit that! I'll have ye arrested!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest ahead,&rdquo; replied Orde coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reed stormed back and forth for a moment, then departed at full speed up
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys, get as much done as possible,&rdquo; urged Orde. &ldquo;We better get back
      in the brush, or he may try to take in the whole b'iling of us on some
      sort of a blanket warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the other boys?&rdquo; inquired North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave one of them a telegram to send to Daly,&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;Daly will
      be up to bail them out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more they hid in the woods; and again, after a longer interval, the
      mill owner and the sheriff reappeared. Reed appeared to be expostulating
      violently, and a number of times pointed up river; but the sheriff went
      ahead stolidly to the dam, summoned those working below, and departed up
      the road as before. Reed stood uncertain until he saw the rivermen
      beginning to re-emerge from the brush, then followed the officer at top
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without the necessity of command, a half-dozen men leaped down on the
      apron. The previous crews had made considerable progress in weakening the
      heavy supports. As soon as these should be cut out and the backing
      removed, the mere sawing through of the massive sill should carry away the
      whole obstruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next time will decide it,&rdquo; remarked Orde. &ldquo;If the sheriff brings a posse
      and sits down to lay for us, of course we won't be able to get near to
      finish the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think that of George Morris,&rdquo; commented Sims in an aggrieved
      way. &ldquo;He was a riverman himself once before he was sheriff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got to obey orders, and serve a warrant when it's issued, of
      course,&rdquo; replied Orde to this. &ldquo;What did you expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of another hour, which brought the time to four o'clock, the
      sheriff made his third appearance&mdash;this time in a side-bar buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I dared join that confab,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;and hear what's going on,
      but I'm afraid he'd jug me sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn't jug me,&rdquo; spoke up Newmark. &ldquo;I'll go down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully for you!&rdquo; agreed Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man departed in his precise, methodical manner, picking his way
      rather mincingly among the inequalities of the trail. In spite of the worn
      and wrinkled condition of his garments, they retained something of a city
      hang and smartness that sharply differentiated their wearer from even the
      well-dressed citizens of a smaller town. They seemed to match the refined,
      shrewd, but cold intelligence of his lean and nervous face.
    </p>
    <p>
      About sunset he returned from a scene which the distant spectators had
      watched with breathless interest. It was in essence only a repetition of
      the two that had preceded it, but Reed had evidently gone almost to the
      point of violence in his insistence, and the sheriff had shaken him off
      rudely. Finally, Morris and his six prisoners had trailed away. The
      sheriff and North's friend occupied the seat of the buggy, while the other
      five trudged peaceably alongside. Once again Reed clattered away on his
      bony steed, but this time ahead of the official party.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a whoop the river crew, now reduced to a scant dozen, rushed down to
      meet the too deliberate Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; they demanded, crowding about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reed wanted the sheriff to stay and protect the dam,&rdquo; reported Newmark in
      his brief, dry manner. &ldquo;Sheriff refused. Said his duty was simply to
      arrest on warrant, and as often as Reed got out warrants, he'd serve them.
      Reed said, then, he should get a posse and hunt up Orde and the rest of
      them. Sheriff replied that as far as he could see, the terms of his
      warrant were covered by the men he found working on the dam, Reed demanded
      protection, Sheriff said for him to get an injunction, and it would be
      enforced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's all right,&rdquo; interjected Orde with satisfaction. &ldquo;We'll have
      her cut through before he gets that injunction, and I guess I've got men
      enough here and down river to get through before we're ALL arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Newmark, &ldquo;that's all very well. But now he's gone to telegraph
      the governor to send the troops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde whistled a jig tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of expected that, boys,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Let's see. The next train out
      from Redding&mdash;They'll be here by five in the morning at soonest. Hope
      it'll be later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; asked Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take chances,&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;All you boys get to work. Zeke,&rdquo; he
      commanded one of the cookees, &ldquo;go up road, and report if Morris comes
      back. I reckon this time we'll have to scatter if he comes after us. I
      hope we won't have to, though. Like to keep everything square on account
      of this State troop business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun had dropped below the fringe of trees, which immediately etched
      their delicate outlines against a pale, translucent green sky. Two
      straight, thin columns of smoke rose from the neglected camp-fires. Orde,
      glancing around him, noticed these.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he commanded sharply, &ldquo;get at your grub! Make some coffee right
      off, and bring it down. Get the lanterns from the wanigan, and bring them
      to the dam. Come on, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over a score of men attacked the sluice-way, for by now part of the rear
      crew had come down river. The pond above had recovered its volume. Water
      was beginning to trickle over the top of the gate. In a short time
      progress became difficult, almost impossible, The men worked up to their
      knees in swift water. They could not see, and the strokes of axe or pick
      lost much of their force against the liquid. Dusk fell. The fringe of the
      forest became mysterious in its velvet dark. Silver streaks, of a supernal
      calm, suggested the reaches of the pond. Above, the sky's day surface
      unfolded and receded and dissolved and melted away until, through the pale
      afterglow, one saw beyond into the infinities. Down by the sluice a dozen
      lanterns flickered and blinked yellow against the blue-blackness of the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some time Orde called his crew off and opened the sluice-gates. The
      water had become too deep for effective work, and a half hour's flow would
      reduce the pressure. The time was occupied in eating and in drying off
      about the huge fire the second cookee had built close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water cold, boys?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some,&rdquo; was his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to quit?&rdquo; he inquired, with mock solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nary quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde's shout of laughter broke the night silence of the whispering breeze
      and the rushing water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll stick to 'em like death to a dead nigger,&rdquo; was his comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark, having extracted a kind of cardigan jacket from the bag he had
      brought with him as far as the mill, looked at the smooth, iron-black
      water and shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the meal was finished, the men lit their pipes and went back to work
      philosophically. With entire absorption in the task, they dug, chopped,
      and picked. The dull sound of blows, the gurgle and trickle of the water,
      the occasional grunt or brief comment of a riverman alone broke the calm
      of evening. Now that the sluice-gate was down and the water had ceased
      temporarily to flow over it, the work went faster. Orde, watching with the
      eye of an expert, vouchsafed to the taciturn Newmark that he thought
      they'd make it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near midnight, however, a swaying lantern was seen approaching. Orde,
      leaping to his feet with a curse at the boy on watch, heard the sound of
      wheels. A moment later, Daly's bulky form stepped into the illumination of
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde wandered over to where his principal stood peering about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there you are!&rdquo; cried Daly angrily. &ldquo;What in hell you up to here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Running logs,&rdquo; replied Orde coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Running logs!&rdquo; shouted Daly, tugging at his overcoat pocket, and finally
      producing a much-folded newspaper. &ldquo;How about this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde unfolded the paper and lowered it to the campfire. It was an extra,
      screaming with wood type. He read it deliberately over.
    </p>
    <p>
      WAR!
    </p>
    <p>
      the headline ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      RIOTING AND BLOODSHED IN THE WOODS RIVERMEN AND DAM OWNERS CLASH!
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a vague and highly coloured statement to the effect that an
      initial skirmish had left the field in possession of the rivermen, in
      spite of the sheriff and a large posse, but that troops were being rushed
      to the spot, and that this &ldquo;high-handed defiance of authority&rdquo; would
      undoubtedly soon be suppressed. It concluded truthfully with the statement
      that the loss of life was as yet unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde folded up the paper and handed it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know any better than to get into that kind of a row down here?&rdquo;
       Daly had been saying. &ldquo;Do you want to bring us up for good here? Don't you
      realise that this isn't the northern peninsula? What are you trying to do,
      any way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I do,&rdquo; replied Orde placidly. &ldquo;Come along here till I show you the
      situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later, Daly, relieved in his mind, was standing by the fire
      drinking hot coffee and laughing at Orde's description of Reed's plug hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Orde's satisfaction, the sheriff did not reappear. Reed evidently now
      pinned his faith to the State troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night the work went on, the men spelling each other at intervals of
      every few hours. By three o'clock the main abutments had been removed. The
      gate was then blocked to prevent its fall when its nether support should
      be withdrawn, and two men, leaning over cautiously, began at arm's-length
      to deliver their axe-strokes against the middle of the sill-timbers of the
      sluice itself, notching each heavy beam deeply that the force of the
      current might finally break it in two. The night was very dark, and very
      still. Even the night creatures had fallen into the quietude that precedes
      the first morning hours. The muffled, spaced blows of the axes, the
      low-voiced comments or directions of the workers, the crackle of the fire
      ashore were thrown by contrast into an undue importance. Men in blankets,
      awaiting their turn, slept close to the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the vast silence of before dawn was broken by a loud and exultant
      yell from one of the axemen. At once the two scrambled to the top of the
      dam. The blanketed figures about the fire sprang to life. A brief instant
      later the snapping of wood fibres began like the rapid explosions of
      infantry fire; a crash and bang of timbers smote the air; and then the
      river, exultant, roaring with joy, rushed from its pent quietude into the
      new passage opened for it. At the same moment, as though at the signal, a
      single bird, premonitor of the yet distant day, lifted up his voice,
      clearly audible above the tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde stormed into the camp up stream, his eyes bright, his big voice
      booming exultantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roll out, you river-hogs!&rdquo; he shouted to those who had worked out their
      shifts earlier in the night. &ldquo;Roll out, you web-footed sons of guns, and
      hear the little birds sing praise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark, who had sat up the night through, and now shivered sleepily by
      the fire, began to hunt around for the bed-roll he had, earlier in the
      evening, dumped down somewhere in camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that's all,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Just a case of run logs now. I'll turn
      in for a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Orde, a thick slice of bread half-way to his lips, had frozen in an
      attitude of attentive listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faint, still in the depths of the forest, the wandering morning breeze
      bore to their ears a sound whose difference from the louder noises nearer
      at hand alone rendered it audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The troops!&rdquo; exclaimed Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized a lantern and returned down the trail, followed eagerly by
      Newmark and every man in camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troops coming!&rdquo; said Orde to Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men drew a little to one side, watching the dim line of the forest,
      dark against the paling sky. Shadows seemed to stir in its blackness. They
      heard quite distinctly the clink of metal against metal. A man rode out of
      the shadow and reined up by the fire. &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; commanded a harsh voice. The
      rivermen could make out the troops&mdash;three or four score of them&mdash;standing
      rigid at attention. Reed, afoot now in favour of the commanding officer,
      pushed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is in charge here?&rdquo; inquired the officer crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Orde, stepping forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to inquire, sir, if you have gone mad to counsel your men to
      resist civil authority?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not resisted civil authority,&rdquo; replied Orde respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been otherwise reported.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reports have been false. The sheriff of this county has arrested
      about twenty of my men single-handed and without the slightest trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morris,&rdquo; cried the officer sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; replied the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is what this man says true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sure is. Never had so little fuss arrestin' rivermen before in my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer's face turned a slow brick-red. For a moment he said nothing,
      then exploded with the utmost violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why the devil am I dragged up here with my men in the night?&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;Who's responsible for this insanity, anyway? Don't you know,&rdquo; he
      roared at Reed, who that moment swung within his range of vision, &ldquo;that I
      have no standing in the presence of civil law? What do you mean getting me
      up here to your miserable little backwoods squabbles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reed started to say something, but was immediately cut short by the irate
      captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've nothing to do with that; settle it in court. And what's more, you'll
      have something yourself to settle with the State! About, face! Forward,
      march!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men faded into the gray light as though dissolved by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep and respectful silence fell upon the men, which was broken by
      Orde's solemn and dramatic declamation.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The King of France and twice ten thousand men
      Marched up the hill, and then marched down again,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      he recited; then burst into his deep roar of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you see, boys,&rdquo; he said, digging his fists into his eyes, &ldquo;if you'd
      put up a row, what we'd have got into. No blue-coats in mine, thank you.
      Well, push the grub pile, and then get at those logs. It's a case of
      flood-water now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Reed, having recovered from his astonishment, had still his say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell ye, I'm not done with ye yet,&rdquo; he threatened, shaking his bony
      forefinger in Orde's face. &ldquo;I'll sue ye for damages, and I'll GIT 'em,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, you old mossback,&rdquo; said Orde, thrusting his bulky form to the
      fore, &ldquo;you sue just as soon as you want to. You can't get at it any too
      quick to suit us. But just now you get out of this camp, and you stay out.
      You're an old man, and we don't want to be rough with you, but you're
      biting off more than you can chew. Skedaddle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reed hesitated, waving his long arms about, flail-like, as though to begin
      a new oration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, do hop along,&rdquo; urged Orde. &ldquo;We'll pay you any legitimate damages, of
      course, but you can't expect to hang up a riverful of logs just on a
      notion. And we're sick of you. Oh, hell, then! See here, you two; just see
      that this man leaves camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde turned square on his heel. Reed, after a glance at the two huge
      rivermen approaching, beat a retreat to his mill, muttering and wrathful
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye, boys,&rdquo; said Daly, pulling on his overcoat; &ldquo;I'll just get
      along and bail the boys out of that village calaboose. I reckon they've
      had a good night's rest. Be good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fringe of trees to eastward showed clearly against the whitening sky.
      Hundreds of birds of all kinds sang in an ecstasy. Another day had begun.
      Already men with pike-poles were guiding the sullen timbers toward the
      sluice-way.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Newmark awoke once more to interest in affairs, the morning was well
      spent. On the river the work was going forward with the precision of
      clockwork. The six-foot lowering of the sluice-way had produced a fine
      current, which sucked the logs down from above. Men were busily engaged in
      &ldquo;sacking&rdquo; them from the sides of the pond toward its centre, lest the
      lowering water should leave them stranded. Below the dam the jam crew was
      finding plenty to do in keeping them moving in the white-water and the
      shallows. A fine sun, tempered with a prophetic warmth of later spring,
      animated the scene. Reed had withdrawn to the interior of his mill, and
      appeared to have given up the contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the logs shot away down the current, running freely. To these the
      crews were not required to pay any attention. With luck, a few of the
      individual timbers would float ten, even twenty, miles before some chance
      eddy or fortuitous obstruction would bring them to rest. Such eddies and
      obstructions, however, drew a constant toll from the ranks of the
      free-moving logs, so that always the volume of timbers floating with the
      current diminished, and always the number of logs caught and stranded
      along the sides of the river increased. To restore these to the faster
      water was the especial province of the last and most expert crew&mdash;the
      rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde discovered about noon that the jam crew was having its troubles.
      Immediately below Reed's dam ran a long chute strewn with boulders, which
      was alternately a shallow or a stretch of white-water according as the
      stream rose or fell. Ordinarily the logs were flushed over this declivity
      by opening the gate, behind which a head of water had been accumulated.
      Now, however, the efficiency of the gate had been destroyed. Orde early
      discovered that he was likely to have trouble in preventing the logs
      rushing through the chute from grounding into a bad jam on the rapids
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the jam crew succeeded in keeping the &ldquo;wings&rdquo; clear. In the
      centre of the stream, however, a small jam formed, like a pier. Along the
      banks logs grounded, and were rolled over by their own momentum into
      places so shallow as to discourage any hope of refloating them unless by
      main strength. As the sluicing of the nine or ten million feet that
      constituted this particular drive went forward, the situation rapidly
      became worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, we've got to get flood-water unless we want to run into an awful job
      there,&rdquo; said Orde to the foreman. &ldquo;I wonder if we can't drop that gate
      'way down to get something for a head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men examined the chute and the sluice-gate attentively for some
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we could clear out the splinters and rubbish, we might spike a couple
      of saplings on each side for the gate to slide down into,&rdquo; speculated
      North. &ldquo;Might try her on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The logs were held up in the pond, and a crew of men set to work to cut
      away, as well as they might in the rush of water, the splintered ends of
      the old sill and apron. It was hard work. Newmark, watching, thought it
      impracticable. The current rendered footing impossible, so all the work
      had to be done from above. Wet wood gripped the long saws vice-like, so
      that a man's utmost strength could scarcely budge them. The water deadened
      the force of axe-blows. Nevertheless, with the sure persistence of the
      riverman, they held to it. Orde, watching them a few moments, satisfied
      himself that they would succeed, and so departed up river to take charge
      of the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      This crew he found working busily among some overflowed woods. They were
      herding the laggards of the flock. The subsidence of the water consequent
      upon the opening of the sluice-gate had left stranded and in shallows many
      hundreds of the logs. These the men sometimes, waist deep in the icy
      water, owing to the extreme inequality of the bottom, were rolling over
      and over with their peavies until once more they floated. Some few the
      rivermen were forced to carry bodily, ten men to a side, the peavies
      clamped in as handles. When once they were afloat, the task became easier.
      From the advantage of deadwood, stumps, or other logs the &ldquo;sackers&rdquo; pushed
      the unwieldy timbers forward, leaping, splashing, heaving, shoving, until
      at last the steady current of the main river seized the logs and bore them
      away. With marvellous skill they topped the dripping, bobby, rolling
      timbers, treading them over and over, back and forth, in unconscious
      preservation of equilibrium.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal of noise and fun at the rear. The crew had been
      divided, and a half worked on either side the river. A rivalry developed
      as to which side should advance fastest in the sacking. It became a race.
      Momentary success in getting ahead of the other fellow was occasion for
      exultant crowing, while a mishap called forth ironic cheers and catcalls
      from the rival camp. Just as Orde came tramping up the trail, one of the
      rivermen's caulks failed to &ldquo;bite&rdquo; on an unusually smooth, barked surface.
      His foot slipped; the log rolled; he tried in vain to regain his balance,
      and finally fell in with a heavy splash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire river suspended work to send up a howl of delight. As the
      unfortunate crawled out, dripping from head to foot, he was greeted by a
      flood of sarcasm and profane inquiry that left no room for even his
      acknowledged talents of repartee. Cursing and ashamed, he made his way
      ashore over the logs, spirting water at every step. There he wrung out his
      woollen clothes as dry as he could, and resumed work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had Orde the opportunity to look about at the progress making,
      however, before he heard his name shouted from the bank. Looking up, to
      his surprise he saw the solemn cook waving a frantic dish-towel at him.
      Nothing could induce the cook to attempt the logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Charlie?&rdquo; asked Orde, leaping ashore and stamping the loose
      water from his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all off,&rdquo; confided the cook pessimistically. &ldquo;It's no good. He's
      stopped us now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's off? Who's stopped what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reed. He's druv the men from the dam with a shotgun. We might as well
      quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shotgun, hey!&rdquo; exclaimed Orde. &ldquo;Well, the old son of a gun!&rdquo; He thought a
      moment, his lips puckered as though to whistle; then, as usual, he laughed
      amusedly. &ldquo;Let's go take a look at the army,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung away at a round pace, followed rather breathlessly by the cook.
      The trail led through the brush across a little flat point, up over a high
      bluff where the river swung in, down to another point, and across a pole
      trail above a marsh to camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pole trail consists of saplings laid end to end, and supported three or
      four feet above wet places by means of sawbuck-like structures at their
      extremities. To a river-man or a tight-rope dancer they are easy walks.
      All others must proceed cautiously in contrite memory of their sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde marched across the first two lengths confidently enough. Then he
      heard a splash and lamentations. Turning, he perceived Charlie, covered
      with mud, in the act of clambering up one of the small trestles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't got no caulks!&rdquo; ran the lamentations. &ldquo;The &mdash;&mdash; of a
      &mdash;&mdash; of a pole-trail, anyways!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked ahead gingerly, threw his hands aloft, bent forward, then
      suddenly protruded his stomach, held out one foot in front of him,
      spasmodically half turned, and then, realising the case hopeless, wilted
      like a wet rag, to clasp the pole trail both by arm and leg. This saved
      him from falling off altogether, but swung him underneath, where he hung
      like the sloths in the picture-books. A series of violent wriggles brought
      him, red-faced and panting, astride the pole, whence, his feelings beyond
      mere speech, he sadly eyed his precious derby, which lay, crown up, in the
      mud below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde contemplated the spectacle seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry I haven't got time to enjoy you just now, Charlie,&rdquo; he remarked.
      &ldquo;I'd take it slower, if I were you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He departed, catching fragments of vows anent never going on any more
      errands for nobody, and getting his time if ever again he went away from
      his wanigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde stopped short outside the fringe of brush to utter another
      irrepressible chuckle of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The centre of the dam was occupied by Reed. The old man was still in full
      regalia, his plug hat fuzzier than ever, and thrust even farther back on
      his head, his coat-tails and loose trousers flapping at his every movement
      as he paced back and forth with military precision. Over his shoulder he
      carried a long percussion-lock shotgun. Not thirty feet away, perched
      along the bank, for all the world like a row of cormorants, sat the
      rivermen, watching him solemnly and in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; inquired Orde, approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man surveyed him with a snort of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the law of the land don't protect me, I'll protect myself, sir,&rdquo; he
      proclaimed. &ldquo;I give ye fair warning! I ain't a-going to have my property
      interfered with no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;we have a right to run our logs through. It's an
      open river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hev ye been running your logs through?&rdquo; cried the old man excitedly.
      &ldquo;Hev ye? First off ye begin to tear down my dam; and then, when the river
      begins a-roarin' and a-ragin' through, then you tamper with my
      improvements furthermore, a-lowerin' the gate and otherwise a-modifyin' my
      structure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde stepped forward to say something further. Immediately Reed wheeled,
      his thumb on the hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old Spirit of '76,&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;Don't shoot; I'll come
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked back to the waiting row, smiling quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you calamity howlers, what do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody answered, but everybody looked expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think he'd shoot?&rdquo; inquired Orde of Tom North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he would,&rdquo; replied North earnestly. &ldquo;That crazy-headed kind are
      just the fellers to rip loose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think myself he probably would,&rdquo; agreed Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; spoke up Newmark, &ldquo;whatever the status of the damage suits, you
      have the legal right to run your logs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde rolled a quizzical eye in his direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Per-fect-ly correct, son,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;but we're engaged in the happy
      occupation of getting out logs. By the time the law was all adjusted and a
      head of steam up, the water'd be down. In this game, you get out logs
      first, and think about law afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about legal damages?&rdquo; insisted Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legal damages!&rdquo; scoffed Orde. &ldquo;Legal damages! Why, we count legal damages
      as part of our regular expenses&mdash;like potatoes. It's lucky it's so,&rdquo;
       he added. &ldquo;If anybody paid any attention to legal technicalities, there'd
      never be a log delivered. A man always has enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are you going to do?&rdquo; persisted Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde thrust back his felt hat and ran his fingers through his short, crisp
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you've got me,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;but, if necessary, we'll pile the
      old warrior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the edge of the dam and stood looking down current. For
      perhaps a full minute he remained there motionless, his hat clinging to
      one side, his hand in his hair. Then he returned to the grimly silent
      rivermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he commanded briefly, &ldquo;get your peavies and come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way past the mill to the shallows below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a trifle of wading to do,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Bring down two logs&mdash;fairly
      big&mdash;and hold them by that old snag,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Whoa-up! Easy!
      Hold them end on&mdash;no, pointing up stream&mdash;fix 'em about ten foot
      apart&mdash;that's it! George, drive a couple of stakes each side of them
      to hold 'em. Correct! Now, run down a couple dozen more and pile them
      across those two&mdash;side on to the stream, of course. Roll 'em up&mdash;that's
      the ticket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde had been splashing about in the shallow water, showing where each
      timber was to be placed. He drew back, eyeing the result with
      satisfaction. It looked rather like a small and bristly pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next he cast his eye about and discovered a partially submerged boulder on
      a line with the newly completed structure. Against this he braced the ends
      of two more logs, on which he once more caused to be loaded at right
      angles many timbers. An old stub near shore furnished him the basis of a
      third pier. He staked a thirty-inch butt for a fourth; and so on, until
      the piers, in conjunction with the small centre jam already mentioned,
      extended quite across the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was accomplished in a very short time, and immediately below the
      mill, but beyond sight from the sluice-gate of the dam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; commanded Orde, &ldquo;shove off some shore logs, and let them come
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have a jam sure,&rdquo; objected Purdy stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my son, would we?&rdquo; mocked Orde. &ldquo;I surely hope not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stray logs floating down with the current the rivermen caught and
      arranged to the best possible advantage about the improvised piers. A good
      riverman understands the correlation of forces represented by saw-logs and
      water-pressure. He knows how to look for the key-log in breaking jams; and
      by the inverse reasoning, when need arises he can form a jam as expertly
      as Koosy-oonek himself&mdash;that bad little god who brings about the
      disagreeable and undesired&mdash;&ldquo;who hides our pipes, steals our last
      match, and brings rain on the just when they want to go fishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So in ten seconds after the shore logs began drifting down from above, the
      jam was taking shape. Slowly it formed, low and broad. Then, as the water
      gathered pressure, the logs began to slip over one another. The weight of
      the topmost sunk those beneath to the bed of the stream. This to a certain
      extent dammed back the water. Immediately the pressure increased. More
      logs were piled on top. The piers locked the structure. Below the
      improvised dam the water fell almost to nothing, and above it, swirling in
      eddies, grumbling fiercely, bubbling, gurgling, searching busily for an
      opening, the river, turned back on itself, gathered its swollen and angry
      forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, boys,&rdquo; said Orde with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way to the bank and sat down. The men followed his example.
      Every moment the water rose, and each instant, as more logs came down the
      current, the jam became more formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can stand that pressure,&rdquo; breathed Newmark, fascinated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bigger the pressure the tighter she locks,&rdquo; replied Orde, lighting
      his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high bank where the men sat lay well above the reach of the water. Not
      so the flat on which stood Reed's mill. In order to take full advantage of
      the water-power developed by the dam, the old man had caused his structure
      to be built nearly at a level with the stream. Now the river, backing up,
      rapidly overflowed this flat. As the jam tightened by its own weight and
      the accumulation of logs, the water fairly jumped from the lowest floor of
      the mill to the one above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde had not long to wait for Reed's appearance. In less than five minutes
      the old man descended on the group, somewhat of his martial air abated,
      and something of a vague anxiety manifest in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter here?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter?&rdquo; inquired Orde easily. &ldquo;Oh, nothing much, just a little jam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's flooding my mill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I perceive,&rdquo; replied Orde, striking a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don't you break it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old warrior ran up the bank to where he could get a good view of his
      property. The water was pouring into the first-floor windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he cried, running back. &ldquo;I've a lot of grain up-stairs. It'll be
      ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not interested,&rdquo; repeated Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reed was rapidly losing control of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I've got a lot of money invested here!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You miserable
      blackguard, you're ruining me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde replaced his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reed ran back and forth frantically, disappeared, returned bearing an
      antiquated pike-pole, and single-handed and alone attacked the jam!
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonishment and delight held the rivermen breathless for a moment. Then a
      roar of laughter drowned even the noise of the waters. Men pounded each
      other on the back, rolled over and over, clutching handfuls of earth,
      struggled weak and red-faced for breath as they saw against the sky-line
      of the bristling jam the lank, flapping figure with the old plug hat
      pushing frantically against the immovable statics of a mighty power. The
      exasperation of delay, the anxiety lest success be lost through the mulish
      and narrow-minded obstinacy of one man, the resentment against another
      obstacle not to be foreseen and not to be expected in a task redundantly
      supplied with obstacles of its own&mdash;these found relief at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; breathed Newmark softly to himself. &ldquo;Don Quixote and the
      windmills!&rdquo; Then he added vindictively, &ldquo;The old fool!&rdquo; although, of
      course, the drive was not his personal concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Orde seemed to see the other side. And on Orde the responsibility,
      uncertainty, and vexation had borne most heavily, for the success of the
      undertaking was in his hands. With a few quick leaps he had gained the old
      man's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Reed,&rdquo; he said kindly, &ldquo;you can't break this jam. Come ashore
      now, and let up. You'll kill yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reed turned to him, a wild light in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break it!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;You're ruining me. I've got all my money in that
      mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;we've got a lot of money in our logs too. You haven't
      treated us quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reed glanced frantically toward the flood up stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Orde, taking him gently by the arm. &ldquo;There's no reason you
      and I shouldn't get along together all right. Maybe we're both a little
      hard-headed. Let's talk it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the old man ashore, and out of earshot of the rivermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of ten minutes he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War's over, boys!&rdquo; he shouted cheerfully. &ldquo;Get in and break that jam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once the crew swarmed across the log barrier to a point above the
      centre pier. This they attacked with their peavies, rolling the top logs
      off into the current below. In less than no time they had torn out quite a
      hole in the top layer. The river rushed through the opening. Immediately
      the logs in the wings were tumbled in from either side. At first the men
      had to do all of the work, but soon the river itself turned to their
      assistance. Timbers creaked and settled, or rose slightly buoyant as the
      water loosened the tangle. Men trod on the edge of expectation. Constantly
      the logs shifted, and as constantly the men shifted also, avoiding the
      upheavals and grindings together, wary eyes estimating the correlation of
      the forces into whose crushing reach a single misstep would bring them.
      The movement accelerated each instant, as the music of the play hastens to
      the climax. Wood fibres smashed. The whole mass seemed to sink down and
      forward into a boiling of waters. Then, with a creak and a groan, the jam
      moved, hesitated, moved again; finally, urged by the frantic river, went
      out in a majestic crashing and battering of logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first movement Newmark expected the rivermen to make their escape.
      Instead, they stood at attention, their peavies poised, watching cat-eyed
      the symptoms of the break. Twice or thrice several of the men, observing
      something not evident to Newmark's unpractised eye, ran forward, used
      their peavies vigorously for a moment or so, and stood back to watch the
      result. Only at the very last, when it would seem that some of them must
      surely he caught, did the river-jacks, using their peavy-shafts as
      balancing poles, zigzag calmly to shore across the plunging logs. Newmark
      seemed impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a close shave,&rdquo; said he to the last man ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired the riverman. &ldquo;Didn't see it. Somebody fall down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; explained Newmark; &ldquo;getting in off those logs without getting
      caught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the man indifferently, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The going out of the jam drained the water from the lower floors of the
      mill; the upper stories and the grain were still safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      By evening the sluice-gate had been roughly provided with pole guides down
      which to slide to the bed of the river. The following morning saw the work
      going on as methodically as ever. During the night a very good head of
      water had gathered behind the lowered gate. The rear crew brought down the
      afterguard of logs to the pond. The sluicers with their long pike-poles
      thrust the logs into the chute. The jam crew, scattered for many miles
      along the lower stretches, kept the drive going; running out over the
      surface of the river like water-bugs to thrust apart logs threatening to
      lock; leaning for hours on the shafts of their peavies watching
      contemplatively the orderly ranks as they drifted by, sleepy, on the bosom
      of the river; occasionally gathering, as the filling of the river gave
      warning, to break a jam. By the end of the second day the pond was clear,
      and as Charlie's wanigan was drifting toward the chute, the first of
      Johnson's drive floated into the head of the pond.

    <h2>
      V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Charlie's wanigan, in case you do not happen to know what such a thing may
      be, was a scow about twenty feet long by ten wide. It was very solidly
      constructed of hewn timbers, square at both ends, was inconceivably
      clumsy, and weighed an unbelievable number of pounds. When loaded, it
      carried all the bed-rolls, tents, provisions, cooking utensils, tools, and
      a chest of tobacco, clothes, and other minor supplies. It was managed by
      Charlie and his two cookees by means of pike-poles and a long sweep at
      either end. The pike-poles assured progress when the current slacked; the
      sweeps kept her head-on when drifting with the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie's temperament was pessimistic at best. When the wanigan was to be
      moved, he rose fairly to the heights of what might be called destructive
      prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The packing began before the men had finished breakfast. Shortly after
      daylight the wanigan, pushed strongly from shore by the pike-poles, was
      drifting toward the chute. When the heavy scow threatened to turn side-on,
      the sweeps at either end churned the water frantically in an endeavour to
      straighten her out. Sometimes, by a misunderstanding, they worked against
      each other. Then Charlie, raging from one to the other of his satellites,
      frothed and roared commands and vituperations. His voice rose to a shriek.
      The cookees, bewildered by so much violence, lost their heads completely.
      Then Charlie abruptly fell to an exaggerated calm. He sat down amidships
      on a pile of bags, and gazed with ostentatious indifference out over the
      pond. Finally, in a voice fallen almost to a whisper, and with an
      elaborate politeness, Charlie proffered a request that his assistants
      acquire the sense God gave a rooster. Newmark, who had elected to
      accompany the wanigan on its voyage, evidently found it vastly amusing,
      for his eyes twinkled behind his glasses. As the wanigan neared the sluice
      through which it must shoot the flood-water, the excitement mounted to
      fever pitch. The water boiled under the strokes of the long steering oars.
      The air swirled with the multitude and vigour of Charlie's commands. As
      many of the driving crew as were within distance gathered to watch. It was
      a supreme moment. As Newmark looked at the smooth rim of the water sucking
      into the chute, he began to wonder why he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the noble ship was pointed right at last, and caught the faster
      water head-on. Even Charlie managed to look cheerful for an instant, and
      to grin at his passenger as he wiped his forehead with a very old, red
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right now,&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zeke and his mate took in the oars. The wanigan shot forward below the
      gate&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      WHACK! BUMP! BANG! and the scow stopped so suddenly that its four men
      plunged forward in a miscellaneous heap, while Zeke narrowly escaped going
      overboard. Almost immediately the water, backed up behind the stern, began
      to overflow into the boat. Newmark, clearing his vision as well as he
      could for lack of his glasses, saw that the scow had evidently run her bow
      on an obstruction, and had been brought to a standstill square beneath the
      sluice-gate. Men seemed to be running toward them. The water was beginning
      to flow the entire length of the boat. Various lighter articles shot past
      him and disappeared over the side. Charlie had gone crazy and was grabbing
      at these, quite uselessly, for as fast as he had caught one thing he let
      it go in favour of another. The cookees, retaining some small degree of
      coolness, were pushing uselessly with pike-poles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark had an inspiration. The more important matters, such as the men's
      clothes-bags, the rolls of bedding, and the heavier supplies of
      provisions, had not yet cut loose from their moorings, although the rapid
      backing of the water threatened soon to convert the wanigan into a chute
      for nearly the full volume of the current. He seized one of the long oars,
      thrust the blade under the edge of a thwart astern laid the shaft of the
      oar across the cargo, and by resting his weight on the handle attempted to
      bring it down to bind the contents of the wanigan to their places. The
      cookees saw what he was about, and came to his assistance. Together they
      succeeded in bending the long hickory sweep far enough to catch its
      handle-end under another, forward, thwart. The second oar was quickly
      locked alongside the first, and not a moment too soon. A rush of water
      forced them all to cling for their lives. The poor old wanigan was almost
      buried by the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now help was at hand. Two or three rivermen appeared at the edge of
      the chute. A moment later old man Reed ran up, carrying a rope. This,
      after some difficulty, was made fast to the bow of the wanigan. A dozen
      men ran with the end of it to a position of vantage from which they might
      be able to pull the bow away from the sunken obstruction, but Orde,
      appearing above, called a halt. After consultation with Reed, another rope
      was brought and the end of it tossed down to the shipwrecked crew. Orde
      pointed to the stern of the boat, revolving his hands in pantomime to show
      that the wanigan would be apt to upset if allowed to get side-on when
      freed. A short rope led to the top of the dam allowed the bow to be lifted
      free of the obstruction; a cable astern prevented the current from
      throwing her broadside to the rush of waters; another cable from the bow
      led her in the way she should go. Ten minutes later she was pulled ashore
      out of the eddy below, very much water-logged, and manned by a drenched
      and disgruntled crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Orde allowed them little chance for lamentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard luck!&rdquo; he said briefly. &ldquo;Hope you haven't lost much. Now get a move
      on you and bail out. You've got to get over the shallows while this head
      is on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all the thanks you get,&rdquo; grumbled Charlie to himself and the other
      three as Orde moved away. &ldquo;Work, slave, get up in the night, drownd
      yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He happily discovered that the pails under the forward thwart had not been
      carried away, and all started in to bail. It was a back-breaking job, and
      consumed the greater part of two hours. Even at the end of that time the
      wanigan, though dry of loose water, floated but sluggishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Bout two ton of water in them bed-rolls and turkeys,&rdquo; grumbled Charlie.
      &ldquo;Well, get at it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark soon discovered that the progress of the wanigan was looked upon
      in the light of a side-show by the rivermen. Its appearance was signal for
      shouts of delighted and ironic encouragement; its tribulations&mdash;which
      at first, in the white-water, were many&mdash;the occasion for
      unsympathetic and unholy joy. Charlie looked on all spectators as enemies.
      Part of the time he merely glowered. Part of the time he tried to reply in
      kind. To his intense disgust, he was taken seriously in neither case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a couple of hours' run the wanigan had overtaken and left far behind
      the rear of the drive. All about floated the logs, caroming gently one
      against the other, shifting and changing the pattern of their brown
      against the blue of the water. The current flowed strongly and smoothly,
      but without obstruction. Everything went well. The banks slipped by
      silently and mysteriously, like the unrolling of a panorama&mdash;little
      strips of marshland, stretches of woodland where the great trees leaned
      out over the river, thickets of overflowed swampland with the water rising
      and draining among roots in a strange regularity of its own. The sun shone
      warm. There was no wind. Newmark wrung out his outer garments, and basked
      below the gunwale. Zeke and his companion pulled spasmodically on the
      sweeps. Charlie, having regained his equanimity together with his old
      brown derby, which he came upon floating sodden in an eddy, marched up and
      down the broad gunwale with his pike-pole, thrusting away such logs as
      threatened interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he at last, &ldquo;we better make camp. We'll be down in the jam
      pretty soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cookees abandoned the sweeps in favour of more pike-poles. By pushing
      and pulling on the logs floating about them, they managed to work the
      wanigan in close to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie, a coil of rope in his hand, surveyed the prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll stop right down there by that little knoll,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaped ashore, made a turn around a tree, and braced himself to snub
      the boat, but unfortunately he had not taken into consideration the &ldquo;two
      ton&rdquo; of water soaked up by the cargo. The weight of the craft relentlessly
      dragged him forward. In vain he braced and struggled. The end of the rope
      came to the tree; he clung for a moment, then let go, and ran around the
      tree to catch it before it should slip into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the wanigan had caught the stronger current at the bend and
      was gathering momentum. Charlie tried to snub at a sapling, and broke the
      sapling; on a stub, and uprooted the stub. Down the banks and through the
      brush he tore at the end of his rope, clinging desperately, trying at
      every solid tree to stop the career of his runaway, but in every instance
      being forced by the danger of jamming his hands to let go. Again he lost
      his derby. The landscape was a blur. Dimly he made out the howls of
      laughter as the outfit passed a group of rivermen. Then abruptly a ravine
      yawned before him, and he let go just in time to save himself a fall. The
      wanigan, trailing her rope, drifted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did she stop until she had overtaken the jam. There, her momentum
      reduced by the closer crowding of the logs, she slowed down enough so that
      Newmark and the cookees managed to work her to the bank and make her fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, after the wanigan's crew had accomplished a hard afternoon's
      work pitching camp and drying blankets, the first of the rear drifted in
      very late after a vain search for camp farther up stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, Charlie,&rdquo; growled one, &ldquo;it's a wonder you wouldn't run
      through to Redding and be done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Charlie, who had been preternaturally calm all the afternoon,
      uttered a shriek of rage, and with a carving-knife chased that man out
      into the brush. Nor would he be appeased to the point of getting supper
      until Orde himself had intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Orde to Newmark later, around the campfire, &ldquo;how does
      river-driving strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is extremely interesting,&rdquo; replied Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like to join the wanigan crew permanently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; returned Newmark drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, stay with us as long as you're having a good time,&rdquo; invited Orde
      heartily, but turning away from his rather uncommunicative visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Newmark acknowledged this, &ldquo;I believe I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Tommy,&rdquo; called Orde across the fire to North, &ldquo;I reckon we've got
      to rustle some more supplies. That shipwreck of ours to-day mighty near
      cleaned us out of some things. Lucky Charlie held his head and locked in
      the bedding with those sweeps, or we'd have been strapped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't do it,&rdquo; grumbled Charlie. &ldquo;It was him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Orde congratulated Newmark. &ldquo;Good work! I'm tickled to death you
      belonged to that crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That old mossback Reed was right on deck with his rope,&rdquo; remarked Johnny
      Simms. &ldquo;That was pretty decent of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old skunk!&rdquo; growled North. &ldquo;He lost us two days with his damn nonsense.
      You let him off too easy, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's a poor old devil,&rdquo; replied Orde easily. &ldquo;He means well enough.
      That's the way the Lord made him. He can't help how he's made.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the thirty-three days of the drive, Newmark, to the surprise of
      everybody, stayed with the work. Some of these days were very
      disagreeable. April rains are cold and persistent&mdash;the proverbs as to
      showers were made for another latitude. Drenched garments are bad enough
      when a man is moving about and has daylight; but when night falls, and the
      work is over, he likes a dry place and a change with which to comfort
      himself. Dry places there were none. Even the interior of the tents became
      sodden by continual exits and entrances of dripping men, while dry
      garments speedily dampened in the shiftings of camp which, in the broader
      reaches of the lower river, took place nearly every day. Men worked in
      soaked garments, slept in damp blankets. Charlie cooked only by virtue of
      persistence. The rivermen ate standing up, as close to the sputtering,
      roaring fires as they could get. Always the work went forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were other times when a golden sun rose each morning a little
      earlier on a green and joyous world. The river ran blue. Migratory birds
      fled busily northward&mdash;robins, flute-voiced blue-birds, warblers of
      many species, sparrows of different kinds, shore birds and ducks, the
      sweet-songed thrushes. Little tepid breezes wandered up and down, warm in
      contrast to the faint snow-chill that even yet lingered in the shadows.
      Sounds carried clearly, so that the shouts and banter of the rivermen were
      plainly audible up the reaches of the river. Ashore moist and aggressive
      green things were pushing up through the watery earth from which, in
      shade, the last frost had not yet departed. At camp the fires roared
      invitingly. Charlie's grub was hot and grateful. The fir beds gave
      dreamless sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark followed the work of the log-drive with great interest. All day
      long he tramped back and forth&mdash;on jam one day, on rear the next. He
      never said much, but watched keenly, and listened to the men's banter both
      on the work and about the evening's fire as though he enjoyed it.
      Gradually the men got used to him, and ceased to treat him as an outsider.
      His thin, eager face, his steel-blue, inquiring eyes behind the glasses,
      his gray felt hat, his lank, tense figure in its gray, became a familiar
      feature. They threw remarks to him, to which he replied briefly and drily.
      When anything interesting was going on, somebody told him about it. Then
      he hurried to the spot, no matter how distant it might be. He used always
      the river trail; he never attempted to ride the logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to depend most on observation, for he rarely asked any
      questions. What few queries he had to proffer, he made to Orde himself,
      waiting sometimes until evening to interview that busy and good-natured
      individual. Then his questions were direct and to the point. They related
      generally to the advisability of something he had seen done; only rarely
      did they ask for explanation of the work itself. That Newmark seemed
      capable of puzzling out for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drive, as has been said, went down as far as Redding in thirty-three
      days. It had its share of tribulation. The men worked fourteen and sixteen
      hours at times. Several bad jams relieved the monotony. Three dams had to
      be sluiced through. Problems of mechanics arose to be solved on the spot;
      problems that an older civilisation would have attacked deliberately and
      with due respect for the seriousness of the situation and the dignity of
      engineering. Orde solved them by a rough-and-ready but very effective rule
      of thumb. He built and abandoned structures which would have furnished
      opportunity for a winter's discussion to some committees; just as, earlier
      in the work, the loggers had built through a rough country some hundreds
      of miles of road better than railroad grade, solid in foundation, and
      smooth as a turnpike, the quarter of which would have occupied the average
      county board of supervisors for five years. And while he was at it, Orde
      kept his men busy and satisfied. Your white-water birler is not an easy
      citizen to handle. Yet never once did the boss appear hurried or
      flustered. Always he wandered about, his hands in his pockets, chewing a
      twig, his round, wind-reddened face puckered humorously, his blue eyes
      twinkling, his square, burly form lazily relaxed. He seemed to meet his
      men almost solely on the plane of good-natured chaffing. Yet the work was
      done, and done efficiently, and Orde was the man responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drive of which Orde had charge was to be delivered at the booms of
      Morrison and Daly, a mile or so above the city of Redding. Redding was a
      thriving place of about thirty thousand inhabitants, situated on a long
      rapids some forty miles from Lake Michigan. The water-power developed from
      the rapids explained Redding's existence. Most of the logs floated down
      the river were carried through to the village at the lake coast, where,
      strung up the river for eight or ten miles, stood a dozen or so big
      saw-mills, with concomitant booms, yards, and wharves. Morrison and Daly,
      however, had built a saw and planing mill at Redding, where they supplied
      most of the local trade and that of the surrounding country-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drive, then, was due to break up as soon as the logs should be safely
      impounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last camp was made some six or eight miles above the mill. From that
      point a good proportion of the rivermen, eager for a taste of the town,
      tramped away down the road, to return early in the morning, more or less
      drunk, but faithful to their job. One or two did not return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the revellers was the cook, Charlie, commonly called The Doctor. The
      rivermen early worked off the effects of their rather wild spree, and
      turned up at noon chipper as larks. Not so the cook. He moped about
      disconsolately all day; and in the evening, after his work had been
      finished, he looked so much like a chicken with the pip that Orde's
      attention was attracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got that dark-brown taste, Charlie?&rdquo; he inquired with mock solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook mournfully shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Large head? Let's feel your pulse. Stick out your tongue, sonny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't been drinking, I tell you!&rdquo; growled Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drinking!&rdquo; expostulated Orde, horrified. &ldquo;Of course not! I hope none of
      MY boys ever take a drink! But that lemon-pop didn't agree with your
      stomach&mdash;now did it, Charlie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I only had two glasses of beer!&rdquo; cried Charlie, goaded, &ldquo;and I
      can prove it by Johnny Challan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde turned to survey the pink-cheeked, embarrassed young boy thus
      designated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many glasses did Johnny Challan have?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't drink none to speak of,&rdquo; spoke up the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why this joyless demeanour?&rdquo; begged Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie grumbled, fiercely inarticulate; but Johnny Challan interposed
      with a chuckle of enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got 'bunked.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us!&rdquo; cried Orde delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was down at McNeill's place,&rdquo; explained Johnny Challan; encouraged by
      the interest of his audience. &ldquo;They was a couple of sports there who
      throwed out three cards on the table and bet you couldn't pick the jack.
      They showed you where the jack was before they throwed, and it surely
      looked like a picnic, but it wasn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three-card monte,&rdquo; said Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; asked Simms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About fifty dollars,&rdquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde turned on the disgruntled cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you had fifty in your turkey, camping with this outfit of hard
      citizens!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You ought to lose it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Challan was explaining to his companions exactly how the game was
      played.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a case of keep your eye on the card, I should think,&rdquo; said big Tim
      Nolan. &ldquo;If you got a quick enough eye to see him flip the card around, you
      ought to be able to pick her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what this sport said,&rdquo; agreed Challan. &ldquo;'Your eye agin my hand,'
      says he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'd like to take a try at her,&rdquo; mused Tim.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this point Newmark broke into the discussion. &ldquo;Have you a pack of
      cards?&rdquo; he asked in his dry, incisive manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody rummaged in a turkey and produced the remains of an old deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe this is a full deck,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I think they's part
      of two decks in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only want three,&rdquo; assured Newmark, reaching his hand for the pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men crowded around close, those in front squatting, those behind
      looking over their shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark cleared a cracker-box of drying socks and drew it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These three are the cards,&rdquo; he said, speaking rapidly. &ldquo;There is the jack
      of hearts. I pass my hands&mdash;so. Pick the jack, one of you,&rdquo; he
      challenged, leaning back from the cracker-box on which lay the three
      cards, back up. &ldquo;Any of you,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;You, North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus directly singled out, the foreman leaned forward and rather
      hesitatingly laid a blunt forefinger on one of the bits of pasteboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word, Newmark turned it over. It was the ten of spades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me try,&rdquo; interposed Tim Nolan, pressing his big shoulders forward. &ldquo;I
      bet I know which it was that time; and I bet I can pick her next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you BET!&rdquo; shrugged Newmark. &ldquo;And that's where the card-sharps
      get you fellows every time. Well, pick it,&rdquo; said he, again deftly flipping
      the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nolan, who had watched keenly, indicated one without hesitation. Again it
      proved to be the ten of spades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody else ambitious?&rdquo; inquired Newmark. Everybody was ambitious; and
      the young man, with inexhaustible patience, threw out the cards, the
      corners of his mouth twitching sardonically at each wrong guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he called a halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time I'd have had all your money,&rdquo; he pointed out. &ldquo;Now, I'll
      pick the jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the last time he made his swift passes and distributed the cards. Then
      quite calmly, without disturbing the three on the cracker-box, he held
      before their eyes the jack of hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation broke from the interested group. Tim Nolan, who was the
      nearest, leaned forward and turned over the three on the board. They were
      the eight of diamonds and two tens of spades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's how the thing is worked nine times out of ten,&rdquo; announced Newmark.
      &ldquo;Once in a while you'll run against a straight game, but not often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you showed us the jack every time before you throwed them!&rdquo; puzzled
      Johnny Simms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleight of hand,&rdquo; explained Newmark. &ldquo;The simplest kind of palming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Charlie,&rdquo; said big Tim, &ldquo;looks to me as if you had just about as
      much chance as a snowball in hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where'd you get onto doing all that, Newmark?&rdquo; inquired North. &ldquo;You ain't
      a tin horn yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark laughed briefly. &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I learned a lot of those
      tricks from a travelling magician in college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this demonstration Orde had sat well in the background, his chin
      propped on his hand, watching intently all that was going on. After the
      comment and exclamations following the exposure of the method had
      subsided, he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how game are you to get Charlie's money back&mdash;and
      then some?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try us,&rdquo; returned big Tim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This game's at McNeill's, and McNeill's is a tough hole,&rdquo; warned Orde.
      &ldquo;Maybe everything will go peaceful, and maybe not. And you boys that go
      with me have got to keep sober. There isn't going to be any row unless I
      say so, and I'm not taking any contract to handle a lot of drunken
      river-hogs as well as go against a game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Nolan, &ldquo;I'm with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thirty or so men of the rear crew then in camp signified their
      intention to stay by the procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't make those sharps disgorge,&rdquo; counselled Newmark. &ldquo;At the first
      look of trouble they will light out. They have it all fixed. Force won't
      do you much good&mdash;and may get some of you shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to use force,&rdquo; denied Orde. &ldquo;I'm just going to play their
      game. But I bet I can make it go. Only I sort of want the moral support of
      the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, you CAN'T win!&rdquo; cried Newmark disgustedly. &ldquo;It's a brace game
      pure and simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about it's being pure,&rdquo; replied Orde drolly, &ldquo;but it's
      simple enough, if you know how to make the wheels go 'round. How is it,
      boys&mdash;will you back my play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And such was their confidence that, in face of Newmark's demonstration,
      they said they would.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the men had been paid off, perhaps a dozen of them hung around the
      yards awaiting evening and the rendezvous named by Orde. The rest drifted
      away full of good intentions, but did not show up again. Orde himself was
      busy up to the last moment, but finally stamped out of the office just as
      the boarding-house bell rang for supper. He surveyed what remained of his
      old crew and grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys, ready for trouble?&rdquo; he greeted them. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They set out up the long reach of Water Street, their steel caulks biting
      deep into the pitted board-walks.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly a mile the street was flanked solely by lumber-yards, small
      mills, and factories. Then came a strip of unimproved land, followed
      immediately by the wooden, ramshackle structures of Hell's Half-Mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the old days every town of any size had its Hell's Half-Mile, or the
      equivalent. Saginaw boasted of its Catacombs; Muskegon, Alpena, Port
      Huron, Ludington, had their &ldquo;Pens,&rdquo; &ldquo;White Rows,&rdquo; &ldquo;River Streets,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Kilyubbin,&rdquo; and so forth. They supported row upon row of saloons, alike
      stuffy and squalid; gambling hells of all sorts; refreshment &ldquo;parlours,&rdquo;
       where drinks were served by dozens of &ldquo;pretty waiter-girls,&rdquo; and huge
      dance-halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proprietors of these places were a bold and unscrupulous lot. In their
      everyday business they had to deal with the most dangerous
      rough-and-tumble fighters this country has ever known; with men bubbling
      over with the joy of life, ready for quarrel if quarrel also spelled fun,
      drinking deep, and heavy-handed and fearless in their cups. But each of
      these rivermen had two or three hundred dollars to &ldquo;blow&rdquo; as soon as
      possible. The pickings were good. Men got rich very quickly at this
      business. And there existed this great advantage in favour of the
      dive-keeper: nobody cared what happened to a riverman. You could pound him
      over the head with a lead pipe, or drug his drink, or choke him to
      insensibility, or rob him and throw him out into the street, or even drop
      him tidily through a trap-door into the river flowing conveniently
      beneath. Nobody bothered&mdash;unless, of course, the affair was so
      bungled as to become public. The police knew enough to stay away when the
      drive hit town. They would have been annihilated if they had not. The only
      fly in the divekeeper's ointment was that the riverman would fight back.
    </p>
    <p>
      And fight back he did, until from one end of his street to the other he
      had left the battered evidences of his skill as a warrior. His constant
      heavy lifting made him as hard as nails and as strong as a horse; the
      continual demand on his agility in riding the logs kept him active and
      prevented him from becoming muscle-bound; in his wild heart was not the
      least trace of fear of anything that walked, crawled, or flew. And he was
      as tireless as machinery, and apparently as indifferent to punishment as a
      man cast in iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add to this a happy and complete disregard of consequences&mdash;to
      himself or others&mdash;of anything he did, and, in his own words, he was
      a &ldquo;hard man to nick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As yet the season was too early for much joy along Hell's Half-Mile.
      Orde's little crew, and the forty or fifty men of the drive that had
      preceded him, constituted the rank and file at that moment in town. A
      little later, when all the drives on the river should be in, and those of
      its tributaries, and the men still lingering at the woods camps, at least
      five hundred woods-weary men would be turned loose. Then Hell's Half-Mile
      would awaken in earnest from its hibernation. The lights would blaze from
      day to day. From its opened windows would blare the music, the cries of
      men and women, the shuffle of feet, the noise of fighting, the shrieks of
      wild laughter, curses deep and frank and unashamed, songs broken and
      interrupted. Crews of men, arms locked, would surge up and down the narrow
      sidewalks, their little felt hats cocked one side, their heads back, their
      fearless eyes challenging the devil and all his works&mdash;and getting
      the challenge accepted. Girls would flit across the lit windows like
      shadows before flames, or stand in the doorways hailing the men jovially
      by name. And every few moments, above the roar of this wild inferno, would
      sound the sudden crash and the dull blows of combat. Only, never was heard
      the bark of the pistol. The fighting was fierce, and it included kicking
      with the sharp steel boot-caulks, biting and gouging; but it barred knives
      and firearms. And when Hell's Half-Mile was thus in full eruption, the
      citizens of Redding stayed away from Water Street after dark. &ldquo;Drive's
      in,&rdquo; said they, and had business elsewhere. And the next group of
      rivermen, hurrying toward the fun, broke into an eager dog-trot. &ldquo;Taking
      the old town apart to-night,&rdquo; they told each other. &ldquo;Let's get in the
      game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To-night, however, the street was comparatively quiet. The saloons were of
      modified illumination. In many of them men stood drinking, but in a
      sociable rather than a hilarious mood. Old friends of the two drives were
      getting together for a friendly glass. The barkeepers were listlessly
      wiping the bars. The &ldquo;pretty waiter-girls&rdquo; gossiped with each other and
      yawned behind their hands. From several doorways Orde's little compact
      group was accosted by the burly saloonkeepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, boys!&rdquo; said they invariably, &ldquo;glad to see you back. Come in and
      have a drink on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well these men knew that one free drink would mean a dozen paid for. But
      the rivermen merely shook their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; sneered one of the girls. &ldquo;Them's no river-jacks! Them's just off
      the hay trail, I bet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But even this time-honoured and generally effective taunt was ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the third block Orde wheeled sharp to the left down a
      dark and dangerous-looking alley. Another turn to the right brought him
      into a very narrow street. Facing this street stood a three-story wooden
      structure, into which led a high-arched entrance up a broad half-flight of
      wooden steps. This was McNeill's.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Orde and his men turned into the narrow street, a figure detached
      itself from the shadow and approached. Orde uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here, Newmark?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied that young man. &ldquo;I want to see this through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With those clothes?&rdquo; marvelled Orde. &ldquo;It's a wonder some of these thugs
      haven't held you up long ago! I'll get Johnny here to go back with you to
      the main street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; argued Newmark, &ldquo;I want to go in with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's dangerous,&rdquo; explained Orde. &ldquo;You're likely to get slugged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can stand it if you can,&rdquo; returned Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said Orde grimly. &ldquo;However, it's your funeral. Come on, if
      you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McNeill's lower story was given over entirely to drinking. A bar ran down
      all one side of the room. Dozens of little tables occupied the floor.
      &ldquo;Pretty waiter-girls&rdquo; were prepared to serve drinks at these latter&mdash;and
      to share in them, at a commission. The second floor was a theatre, and the
      third a dance-hall. Beneath the building were still viler depths. From
      this basement the riverman and the shanty boy generally graduated
      penniless, and perhaps unconscious, to the street. Now, your lumber-jack
      did not customarily arrive at this stage without more or less lively
      doings en route; therefore McNeill's maintained a force of fighters. They
      were burly, sodden men, in striking contrast to the clean-cut, clear-eyed
      rivermen, but strong in their experience and their discipline. To be sure,
      they might not last quite as long as their antagonists could&mdash;a
      whisky training is not conducive to long wind&mdash;but they always lasted
      plenty long enough. Sand-bags and brass knuckles helped some, ruthless
      singleness of purpose counted, and team work finished the job. At times
      the storm rose high, but up to now McNeill had always ridden it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde and his men entered the lower hall, as though sauntering in without
      definite aim. Perhaps a score of men were in the room. Two tables of cards
      were under way&mdash;with a great deal of noisy card-slapping that
      proclaimed the game merely friendly. Eight or ten other men wandered about
      idly, chaffing loudly with the girls, pausing to overlook the card games,
      glancing with purposeless curiosity at the professional gamblers sitting
      quietly behind their various lay-outs. It was a dull evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde wandered about with the rest, a wide, good-natured smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Start your little ball to rolling for that,&rdquo; he instructed the roulette
      man, tossing down a bill. &ldquo;Dropped again!&rdquo; he lamented humorously. &ldquo;Can't
      seem to have any luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drifted on to the crap game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw us the little bones, pardner,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll go you a five on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lost here, and so found himself at the table presided over by the
      three-card monte men. The rest of his party, who had according to
      instructions scattered about the place, now began quietly to gravitate in
      his direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a lay-out is this?&rdquo; inquired Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dealer held up the three cards face out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of an eye have you got, bub?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know. A pretty fair eye. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you could pick out the jack when I throw them out like
      this?&rdquo; asked the dealer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! She's that one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed the gambler with a pretence of disgust, &ldquo;damn if you
      didn't! I bet you five dollars you can't do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take you!&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;Put up your five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Orde was permitted to pick the jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got the best eye that's been in this place since I got here,&rdquo;
       claimed the dealer admiringly. &ldquo;Here, Dennis,&rdquo; said he to his partner,
      &ldquo;try if you can fool this fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dennis obligingly took the cards, threw them, and lost. By this time the
      men, augmented by the idlers not busy with the card games, had drawn
      close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sail into 'em, bub,&rdquo; encouraged one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was that the gamblers, expert in the reading of a man's mood
      and intentions, sensed the fact that Orde might be led to plunge, or
      whether, more simply, they were using him as a capper to draw the crowd
      into their game, it would be difficult to say, but twice more they bungled
      the throw and permitted him to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark plucked him at the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're twenty dollars ahead,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Quit it! I never saw anybody
      beat this game that much before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde merely shrugged him off with an appearance of growing excitement,
      while an HABITUE of the place, probably one of the hired fighters, growled
      into Newmark's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, you damn dude!&rdquo; warned this man. &ldquo;Keep out of what ain't none of
      your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What limit do you put on this game, anyway?&rdquo; Orde leaned forward, his
      eyes alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gamblers spoke swiftly apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you want to bet?&rdquo; asked one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you stand for five hundred dollars?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence fell on the group. Plainly could be heard the men's
      quickened breathing. The shouts and noise from the card parties blundered
      through the stillness. Some one tiptoed across and whispered in the ear of
      the nearest player. A moment later the chairs at the two tables scraped
      back. One of them fell violently to the floor. Their occupants joined the
      tense group about the monte game. All the girls drew near. Only behind the
      bar the white-aproned bartenders wiped their glasses with apparent
      imperturbability, their eyes, however, on their brass knuckles hanging
      just beneath the counter, their ears pricked up for the riot call.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gambler pretended to deliberate, his cool, shifty eyes running over
      the group before him. A small door immediately behind him swung slowly
      ajar an inch or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got the money?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; countered Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently satisfied, the man nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go you, bub, if I lose,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Lay out your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde counted out nine fifty-dollar bills and five tens. Probably no one in
      the group of men standing about had realised quite how much money five
      hundred dollars meant until they saw it thus tallied out before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the gambler, taking up the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Orde. &ldquo;Where's yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; the gambler reassured him. &ldquo;I'm with the house. I
      guess McNeill's credit is good,&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may all be,&rdquo; insisted Orde, &ldquo;but I'm putting up my good money, and I
      expect to see good money put up in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They wrangled over this point for some time, but Orde was obstinate.
      Finally the gamblers yielded. A canvass of the drawer, helped out by the
      bar and the other games, made up the sum. It bulked large on the table
      beside Orde's higher denominations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interested audience now consisted of the dozen men comprised by Orde's
      friends; nearly twice as many strangers, evidently rivermen; eight
      hangers-on of the joint, probably fighters and &ldquo;bouncers&rdquo;; half a dozen
      professional gamblers, and several waitresses. The four barkeepers still
      held their positions. Of these, the rivermen were scattered loosely back
      of Orde, although Orde's own friends had by now gathered compactly enough
      at his shoulder. The mercenaries and gamblers had divided, and flanked the
      table at either side. Newmark, a growing wonder and disgust creeping into
      his usually unexpressive face, recognised the strategic advantage of this
      arrangement. In case of difficulty, a determined push would separate the
      rivermen from the gamblers long enough for the latter to disappear quietly
      through the small door at the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satisfied?&rdquo; inquired the gambler briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her flicker,&rdquo; replied Orde with equal brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gasp of anticipation went up. Quite coolly the gambler made his passes.
      With equal coolness and not the slightest hesitation, Orde planted his
      great red fist on one of the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the jack,&rdquo; he announced, looking the gambler in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it?&rdquo; sneered the dealer. &ldquo;Well, turn it over and let's see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; roared Orde. &ldquo;YOU TURN OVER THE OTHER TWO!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A low oath broke from the gambler, and his face contorted in a spasm. The
      barkeepers slid out from behind the bar. For a moment the situation was
      tense and threatening. The dealer with a sweeping glance again searched
      the faces of those before him. In that moment, probably, he made up his
      mind that an open scandal must be avoided. Force and broken bones, even
      murder, might be all right enough under colour of right. If Orde had
      turned up for a jack the card on which he now held his fist, and then had
      attempted to prove cheating, a cry of robbery and a lively fight would
      have given opportunity for making way with the stakes. But McNeill's could
      not afford to be shown up before thirty interested rivermen as running an
      open-and-shut brace-game. However, the gambler made a desperate try at
      what he must have known was a very forlorn hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't the way this game is played,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Show up your jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the way I play it,&rdquo; replied Orde sternly. &ldquo;These gentlemen heard the
      bet.&rdquo; He reached over and dexterously flipped over the other two cards.
      &ldquo;You see, neither of these is the jack; this must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You win,&rdquo; assented the gambler, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde, his fist still on the third card, began pocketing the stakes with
      the other hand. The gambler reached, palm up, across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the other card,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde picked it up, laughing. For a moment he seemed to hesitate, holding
      the bit of pasteboard tantalisingly outstretched, as though he were going
      to turn also this one face up. Then, quite deliberately he looked to right
      and to left where the fighters awaited their signal, laughed again, and
      handed the card to the gambler.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once pandemonium broke loose. The rivermen of Orde's party fairly
      shouted with joy over the unexpected trick; the employees of the resort
      whispered apart; the gambler explained, low-voiced and angry, his reasons
      for not putting up a fight for so rich a stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All to the bar!&rdquo; yelled Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made a rush, and lined up and ordered their drinks. Orde poured his
      on the floor and took the glass belonging to the man next him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get them to give you another, Tim,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No knock-out drops, if I
      can help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men drank, and some one ordered another round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tim,&rdquo; said Orde, low-voiced, &ldquo;get the crowd together and we'll pull out.
      I've a thousand dollars on me, and they'll sand-bag me sure if I go alone.
      And let's get out right off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later they all stood safely on the lighted thoroughfare of
      Water Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, boys,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;Go easy, and show up at the booms Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned up the street toward the main part of the town. Newmark joined
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll walk a little ways with you,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;And I say, Orde, I want
      to apologise to you. 'Most of the evening I've been thinking you the worst
      fool I ever saw, but you can take care of yourself at every stage of the
      game. The trick was good, but your taking the other fellow's drink beat
      it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde heard no more of Newmark&mdash;and hardly thought of him&mdash;until
      over two weeks later.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the riverman, assuming the more conventional garments of
      civilisation, lived with his parents in the old Orde homestead at the edge
      of town. This was a rather pretentious two-story brick structure, in the
      old solid, square architecture, surrounded by a small orchard, some
      hickories, and a garden. Orde's father had built it when he arrived in the
      pioneer country from New England forty years before. At that time it was
      considered well out in the country. Since then the town had crept to it,
      so that the row of grand old maples in front shaded a stone-guttered
      street. A little patch of corn opposite, and many still vacant lots above,
      placed it, however, as about the present limit of growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Orde was the youngest and most energetic of a large family that had
      long since scattered to diverse cities and industries. He and Grandpa and
      Grandma Orde dwelt now in the big, echoing, old-fashioned house alone,
      save for the one girl who called herself the &ldquo;help&rdquo; rather than the
      servant. Grandpa Orde, now above sixty, was tall, straight, slender. His
      hair was quite white, and worn a little long. His features were finely
      chiselled and aquiline. From them looked a pair of piercing, young, black
      eyes. In his time, Grandpa Orde had been a mighty breaker of the
      wilderness; but his time had passed, and with the advent of a more
      intensive civilisation he had fallen upon somewhat straitened ways.
      Grandma Orde, on the other hand, was a very small, spry old lady, with a
      small face, a small figure, small hands and feet. She dressed in the then
      usual cap and black silk of old ladies. Half her time she spent at her
      housekeeping, which she loved, jingling about from cellar to attic
      store-room, seeing that Amanda, the &ldquo;help,&rdquo; had everything in order. The
      other half she sat in a wooden &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; rocking-chair by a window
      overlooking the garden. Her silk-shod feet rested neatly side by side on a
      carpet-covered hassock, her back against a gay tapestried cushion. Near
      her purred big Jim, a maltese rumoured to weigh fifteen pounds. Above her
      twittered a canary.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the interior of the house itself was in keeping. The low ceilings, the
      slight irregularities of structure peculiar to the rather rule-of-thumb
      methods of the earlier builders, the deep window embrasures due to the
      thickness of the walls, the unexpected passages leading to unsuspected
      rooms, and the fact that many of these apartments were approached by a
      step or so up or a step or so down&mdash;these lent to it a quaint,
      old-fashioned atmosphere enhanced further by the steel engravings, the
      antique furnishings, the many-paned windows, and all the belongings of old
      people who have passed from a previous generation untouched by modern
      ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this house and these people Orde came direct from the greatness of the
      wilderness and the ferocity of Hell's Half-Mile. Such contrasts were
      possible even ten or fifteen years ago. The untamed country lay at the
      doors of the most modern civilisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark, reappearing one Sunday afternoon at the end of the two weeks, was
      apparently bothered. He examined the Orde place for some moments; walked
      on beyond it; finding nothing there, he returned, and after some
      hesitation turned in up the tar sidewalk and pulled at the old-fashioned
      wire bell-pull. Grandma Orde herself answered the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of her fine features, her dainty lace cap and mitts, and the
      stiffness of her rustling black silks, Newmark took off his gray felt hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-afternoon,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Will you kindly tell me where Mr. Orde lives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Orde's,&rdquo; replied the little old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; persisted Newmark, &ldquo;I am looking for Mr. Jack Orde, and I was
      directed here. I am sorry to have troubled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jack Orde lives here,&rdquo; returned Grandma Orde. &ldquo;He is my son. Would
      you like to see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; assented Newmark gravely, his thin, shrewd face masking
      itself with its usual expression of quizzical cynicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step this way, please, and I'll call him,&rdquo; requested his interlocutor,
      standing aside from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark entered the cool, dusky interior, and was shown to the left into a
      dim, long room. He perched on a mahogany chair, and had time to notice the
      bookcases with the white owl atop, the old piano with the yellowing keys,
      the haircloth sofa and chairs, the steel engravings, and the two oil
      portraits, when Orde's large figure darkened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant the young man, who must just have come in from the outside
      sunshine, blinked into the dimness. Newmark, too, blinked back, although
      he could by this time see perfectly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark had known Orde only as a riverman. Like most Easterners, then and
      now, he was unable to imagine a man in rough clothes as being anything but
      essentially a rough man. The figure he saw before him was decently and
      correctly dressed in what was then the proper Sunday costume. His big
      figure set off the cloth to advantage, and even his wind-reddened face
      seemed toned down and refined by the change in costume and surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you, Mr. Newmark!&rdquo; cried Orde in his hearty way, and holding out
      his hand. &ldquo;I'm glad to see you. Where you been? Come on out of there. This
      is the 'company place.'&rdquo; Without awaiting a reply, he led the way into the
      narrow hall, whence the two entered another, brighter room, in which
      Grandma Orde sat, the canary singing above her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;this is Mr. Newmark, who was with us on the drive
      this spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Orde laid her gold-bowed glasses and her black leather Bible on
      the stand beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newmark and I spoke at the door,&rdquo; said she, extending her frail hand
      with dignity. &ldquo;If you were on the drive, Mr. Newmark, you must have been
      one of the High Privates in this dreadful war we all read about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark laughed and made some appropriate reply. A few moments later, at
      Orde's suggestion, the two passed out a side door and back into the
      remains of the old orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's pretty nice here under the trees,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;Sit down and light
      up. Where you been for the last couple of weeks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I caught Johnson's drive and went on down river with him to the lake,&rdquo;
       replied Newmark, thrusting the offered cigar in one corner of his mouth
      and shaking his head at Orde's proffer of a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must like camp life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like it at all,&rdquo; negatived Newmark emphatically, &ldquo;but the drive
      interested me. It interested me so much that I've come back to talk to you
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire ahead,&rdquo; acquiesced Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to ask you a few questions about yourself, and you can answer
      them or not, just as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not bashful about my career,&rdquo; laughed Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; inquired Newmark abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been doing that sort of thing&mdash;driving, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off and on, about six years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you go into that particular sort of thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde selected a twig and carefully threw it at a lump in the turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there's nothing ahead of shovelling but dirt,&rdquo; he replied with a
      quaint grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Newmark, after a pause. &ldquo;Then you think there's more future
      to that sort of thing than the sort of thing the rest of your friends go
      in for&mdash;law, and wholesale groceries, and banking and the rest of
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is for me,&rdquo; replied Orde simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you're merely river-driving on a salary at thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde flushed slowly, and shifted his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so&mdash;Mr. District Attorney,&rdquo; he said drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark started from his absorption in his questioning and shifted his
      unlighted cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does sound like it,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;but I'm not asking all this out of
      idle curiosity. I've got a scheme in my head that I think may work out big
      for us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; assented Orde reservedly, &ldquo;in that case&mdash;I'm foreman on this
      drive because my outfit went kerplunk two years ago, and I'm making a
      fresh go at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Failed?&rdquo; inquired Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partner skedaddled,&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;Now, if you're satisfied with my
      family history, suppose you tell me what the devil you're driving at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was plainly restive under the cross-examination to which he had been
      subjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Newmark, abruptly changing the subject, &ldquo;you know that
      rapids up river flanked by shallows, where the logs are always going
      aground?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Orde, still grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why wouldn't it help to put a string of piers down both sides, with
      booms between them to hold the logs in the deeper water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why isn't it done, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would do it?&rdquo; countered Orde, leaning back more easily in the
      interest of this new discussion. &ldquo;If Daly did it, for instance, then all
      the rest of the drivers would get the advantage of it for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get them to pay their share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde grinned. &ldquo;I'd like to see you get any three men to agree to anything
      on this river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a sort of dam would help at that Spruce Rapids?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! If you improved the river for driving, she'd be easier to drive.
      That goes without saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many firms drive logs on this stream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten,&rdquo; replied Orde, without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many men do they employ?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driving?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About five hundred; a few more or less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now suppose,&rdquo; Newmark leaned forward impressively, &ldquo;suppose a firm should
      be organised to drive ALL the logs on the river. Suppose it improved the
      river with necessary piers, dams, and all the rest of it, so that the
      driving would be easier. Couldn't it drive with less than five hundred
      men, and couldn't it save money on the cost of driving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might,&rdquo; agreed Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the conditions here. If such a firm should be organised and
      should offer to drive the logs for these ten firms at so much a thousand,
      do you suppose it would get the business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would depend on the driving firm,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;You see, mill men have
      got to have their logs. They can't afford to take chances. It wouldn't
      pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that's all right,&rdquo; agreed Newmark, with a gleam of satisfaction
      across his thin face. &ldquo;Would you form a partnership with me having such an
      object in view?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde threw back his head and laughed with genuine amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you don't realise the situation,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We'd have to have a
      few little things like distributing booms, and tugs, and a lot of tools
      and supplies and works of various kinds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'd get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now Orde's turn to ask questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much are you worth?&rdquo; he inquired bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About twenty thousand dollars,&rdquo; replied Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I raise very much more than twenty thousand cents, I'm lucky
      just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much capital would we have to have?&rdquo; asked Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde thought for several minutes, twisting the petal of an old
      apple-blossom between his strong, blunt fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere near seventy-five thousand dollars,&rdquo; he estimated at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's easy,&rdquo; cried Newmark. &ldquo;We'll make a stock company&mdash;say a
      hundred thousand shares. We'll keep just enough between us to control the
      company&mdash;say fifty-one thousand. I'll put in my pile, and you can pay
      for yours out of the earnings of the company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't sound fair,&rdquo; objected Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pay interest,&rdquo; explained Newmark. &ldquo;Then we'll sell the rest of the
      stock to raise the rest of the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can,&rdquo; interjected Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we can,&rdquo; asserted Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde fell into a brown study, occasionally throwing a twig or a particle
      of earth at the offending lump in the turf. Overhead the migratory
      warblers balanced right-side up or up-side down, searching busily among
      the new leaves, uttering their simple calls. The air was warm and soft and
      still, the sky bright. Fat hens clucked among the grasses. A feel of
      Sunday was in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have something to live on,&rdquo; said he thoughtfully at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So must I,&rdquo; said Newmark. &ldquo;We'll have to pay ourselves salaries, of
      course, but the smaller the better at first. You'll have to take charge of
      the men and the work and all the rest of it&mdash;I don't know anything
      about that. I'll attend to the incorporating and the routine, and I'll try
      to place the stock. You'll have to see, first of all, whether you can get
      contracts from the logging firms to drive the logs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell what to charge them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to figure that very closely. You know where these different
      drives would start from, and how long each of them would take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I know the river pretty well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then we'll figure how many days' driving there is for each, and how
      many men there are, and what it costs for wages, grub, tools&mdash;we'll
      just have to figure as near as we can to the actual cost, and then add a
      margin for profit and for interest on our investment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might work out all right,&rdquo; admitted Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm confident it would,&rdquo; asserted Newmark. &ldquo;And there'd be no harm
      figuring it all out, would there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Orde, &ldquo;that would be fun all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Amanda appeared at the back door and waved an apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jack!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Come in to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark looked puzzled, and, as he arose, glanced surreptitiously at his
      watch. Orde seemed to take the summons as one to be expected, however. In
      fact, the strange hour was the usual Sunday custom in the Redding of that
      day, and had to do with the late-church freedom of Amanda and her like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in and eat with us,&rdquo; invited Orde. &ldquo;We'd be glad to have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Newmark declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up to-morrow night, then, at half-past six, for supper,&rdquo; Orde urged
      him. &ldquo;We can figure on these things a little. I'm in Daly's all day, and
      hardly have time except evenings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Newmark assented. Orde walked with him down the deep-shaded
      driveway with the clipped privet hedge on one side, to the iron gate that
      swung open when one drove over a projecting lever. There he said good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he entered the long dining-room, where Grandpa and Grandma
      Orde were already seated. An old-fashioned service of smooth silver and
      ivory-handled steel knives gave distinction to the plain white linen. A
      tea-pot smothered in a &ldquo;cosey&rdquo; stood at Grandma Orde's right. A sirloin
      roast on a noble platter awaited Grandpa Orde's knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde dropped into his place with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Cheep!&rdquo; he remarked to a frantic canary hanging in the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend seems a nice-appearing young man,&rdquo; said Grandma Orde.
      &ldquo;Wouldn't he stay to dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked him,&rdquo; replied Orde, &ldquo;but he couldn't. He and I have a scheme for
      making our everlasting fortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked grandma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde dropped his napkin into his lap with a comical chuckle of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blest if I have the slightest idea, mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Newmark joined us
      on the drive. Said he was a lawyer, and was out in the woods for his
      health. He's been with us, studying and watching the work, ever since.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'll go see Jane Hubbard this evening,&rdquo; Orde remarked to his
      mother, as he arose from the table. This was his method of announcing that
      he would not be home for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Hubbard lived in a low one-story house of blue granite, situated amid
      a grove of oaks at the top of the hill. She was a kindly girl, whose
      parents gave her free swing, and whose house, in consequence, was popular
      with the younger people. Every Sunday she offered to all who came a
      &ldquo;Sunday-night lunch,&rdquo; which consisted of cold meats, cold salad, bread,
      butter, cottage cheese, jam, preserves, and the like, warmed by a cup of
      excellent tea. These refreshments were served by the guests themselves. It
      did not much matter how few or how many came.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Sunday evening in question Orde found about the usual crowd
      gathered. Jane herself, tall, deliberate in movement and in speech, kindly
      and thoughtful, talked in a corner with Ernest Colburn, who was just out
      of college, and who worked in a bank. Mignonne Smith, a plump, rather
      pretty little body with a tremendous aureole of hair like spun golden
      fire, was trying to balance a croquet-ball on the end of a ruler. The ball
      regularly fell off. Three young men, standing in attentive attitudes,
      thereupon dove forward in an attempt to catch it before it should hit the
      floor&mdash;which it generally did with a loud thump. A collapsed chair of
      slender lines stacked against the wall attested previous acrobatics. This
      much Orde, standing in the doorway, looked upon quite as the usual thing.
      Only he missed the Incubus. Searching the room with his eyes, he at length
      discovered that incoherent, desiccated, but persistent youth VIS-A-VIS
      with a stranger. Orde made out the white of her gown in the shadows, the
      willowy outline of her small and slender figure, and the gracious forward
      bend of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company present caught sight of Orde standing in the doorway, and
      suspended occupations to shout at him joyfully. He was evidently a
      favourite. The strange girl in the corner turned to him a white, long
      face, of which he could see only the outline and the redness of the lips
      where the lamplight reached them. She leaned slightly forward and the lips
      parted. Orde's muscular figure, standing square and uncompromising in the
      doorway, the out-of-door freshness of his complexion, the steadiness of
      his eyes laughing back a greeting, had evidently attracted her. Or perhaps
      anything was a relief from the Incubus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're back at last, are you, Jack?&rdquo; drawled Jane in her lazy,
      good-natured way. &ldquo;Come and meet Miss Bishop. Carroll, I want to present
      Mr. Orde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde bowed ceremoniously into the penumbra cast by the lamp's broad shade.
      The girl inclined gracefully her small head with the glossy hair. The
      Incubus, his thin hands clasped on his knee, his sallow face twisted in
      one of its customary wry smiles, held to the edge of his chair with
      characteristic pertinacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Walter,&rdquo; Orde addressed him genially, &ldquo;are you having a good time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes-indeed!&rdquo; replied the Incubus as though it were one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chair was planted squarely to exclude all others. Orde surveyed the
      situation with good-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to keep the other fellow from getting a chance, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes-indeed!&rdquo; replied the Incubus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde bent over, and with great ease lifted Incubus, chair, and all, and
      set him facing Mignonne Smith and the croquet-ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Mignonne,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I've brought you another assistant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the lamp, to find the girl, her dark eyes alight with
      amusement, watching him intently. She held the tip of a closed fan against
      her lips, which brought her head slightly forward in an attitude as though
      she listened. Somehow there was about her an air of poise, of absolute
      balanced repose quite different from Jane's rather awkward statics, and in
      direct contrast to Mignonne's dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter is a very bright man in his own line,&rdquo; said Orde, swinging forward
      a chair, &ldquo;but he mustn't be allowed any monopolies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know I want him so summarily removed?&rdquo; the girl asked him,
      without changing either her graceful attitude of suspended motion or the
      intentness of her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; argued Orde, &ldquo;I got him to say all he ever says to any girl&mdash;'Yes-indeed!'&mdash;so
      you couldn't have any more conversation from him. If you want to look at
      him, why, there he is in plain sight. Besides, I want to talk to you
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you always get what you want?&rdquo; inquired the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one can get anything he wants, if only he wants it bad enough,&rdquo; he
      asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl pondered this for a moment, and finally lowered and opened her
      fan, and threw back her head in a more relaxed attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people,&rdquo; she amended. &ldquo;However, I forgive you. I will even flatter
      you by saying I am glad you came. You look to have reached the age of
      discretion. I venture to say that these boys' idea of a lively evening is
      to throw bread about the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde flushed a little. The last time he had supped at Jane Hubbard's, that
      was exactly what they did do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are young, of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you and I are very old and
      wise. But having a noisy, good time isn't such a great crime&mdash;or is
      it where you came from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl leaned forward, a sparkle of interest in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you and I going to fight?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on you,&rdquo; returned Orde squarely, but with perfect
      good-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      They eyed each other a moment. Then the girl closed her fan, and leaned
      forward to touch him on the arm with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right not to allow me to say mean things about your
      friends, and I am a nasty little snip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde bowed with sudden gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they do throw bread,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both laughed. She leaned back with a movement of satisfaction,
      seeming to sink into the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, tell me; what do you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I do?&rdquo; asked Orde, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Everybody does something out West here. It's a disgrace not to do
      something, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my business! I'm a river-driver just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A river-driver?&rdquo; she repeated, once more leaning forward. &ldquo;Why, I've just
      been hearing a great deal about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, from Mrs. Baggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;Then you know what a drunken, swearing, worthless lot of
      bums and toughs we are, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, in some subtle way she broke the poise of her
      attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Hell's Half-Mile,&rdquo; she reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Orde bitterly, &ldquo;there's Hell's Half-Mile! Whose fault is
      that? My rivermen's? My boys? Look here! I suppose you couldn't understand
      it, if you tried a month; but suppose you were working out in the woods
      nine months of the year, up early in the morning and in late at night.
      Suppose you slept in rough blankets, on the ground or in bunks, ate rough
      food, never saw a woman or a book, undertook work to scare your city men
      up a tree and into a hole too easy, risked your life a dozen times a week
      in a tangle of logs, with the big river roaring behind just waiting to
      swallow you; saw nothing but woods and river, were cold and hungry and
      wet, and so tired you couldn't wiggle, until you got to feeling like the
      thing was never going to end, and until you got sick of it way through in
      spite of the excitement and danger. And then suppose you hit town, where
      there were all the things you hadn't had&mdash;and the first thing you
      struck was Hell's Half-Mile. Say! you've seen water behind a jam, haven't
      you? Water-power's a good thing in a mill course, where it has wheels to
      turn; but behind a jam it just RIPS things&mdash;oh, what's the use
      talking! A girl doesn't know what it means. She couldn't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off with an impatient gesture. She was looking at him intently,
      her lips again half-parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I begin to understand a little,&rdquo; said she softly. She smiled to
      herself. &ldquo;But they are a hard and heartless class in spite of all their
      energy and courage, aren't they?&rdquo; she drew him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard and heartless!&rdquo; exploded Orde. &ldquo;There's no kinder lot of men on
      earth, let me tell you. Why, there isn't a man on that river who doesn't
      chip in five or ten dollars when a man is hurt or killed; and that means
      three or four days' hard work for him. And he may not know or like the
      injured man at all! Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all the excitement?&rdquo; drawled Jane Hubbard behind them. &ldquo;Can't you
      make it a to-be-continued-in-our-next? We're 'most starved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes-indeed!&rdquo; chimed in the Incubus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company trooped out to the dining-room where the table, spread with
      all the good things, awaited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ernest, you light the candles,&rdquo; drawled Jane, drifting slowly along the
      table with her eye on the arrangements, &ldquo;and some of you boys go get the
      butter and the milk-pitcher from the ice-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Orde's relief, no one threw any bread, although the whole-hearted fun
      grew boisterous enough before the close of the meal. Miss Bishop sat
      directly across from him. He had small chance of conversation with her in
      the hubbub that raged, but he gained full leisure to examine her more
      closely in the fuller illumination. Throughout, her note was of fineness.
      Her hands, as he had already noticed, were long, the fingers tapering; her
      wrists were finely moulded, but slender, and running without abrupt
      swelling of muscles into the long lines of her forearm; her figure was
      rounded, but built on the curves of slenderness; her piled, glossy hair
      was so fine that though it was full of wonderful soft shadows denied
      coarser tresses, its mass hardly did justice to its abundance. Her face,
      again, was long and oval, with a peculiar transparence to the skin and a
      peculiar faint, healthy circulation of the blood well below the surface,
      which relieved her complexion of pallor, but did not give her a colour.
      The lips, on the contrary, were satin red, and Orde was mildly surprised,
      after his recent talk, to find them sensitively moulded, and with a
      quaint, child-like quirk at the corners. Her eyes were rather
      contemplative, and so black as to resemble spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her half-scornful references to &ldquo;bread-throwing,&rdquo; she joined
      with evident pleasure in the badinage and more practical fun which struck
      the note of the supper. Only Orde thought to discern even in her more
      boisterous movements a graceful, courteous restraint, to catch in the bend
      of her head a dainty concession to the joy of the moment, to hear in the
      tones of her laughter a reservation of herself, which nevertheless was not
      at all a reservation, against the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the meal was finished, each had his candle to blow out, and then all
      returned to the parlour, leaving the debris for the later attention of the
      &ldquo;hired help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde with determination made his way to Miss Bishop's side. She smiled at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I am a hypocrite as well as a mean little snip,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I
      threw a little bread myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Threw bread?&rdquo; repeated Orde. &ldquo;I didn't see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moon is made of green cheese,&rdquo; she mocked him, &ldquo;and there are
      countries where men's heads do grow beneath their shoulders.&rdquo; She moved
      gracefully away toward Jane Hubbard. &ldquo;Do you Western 'business men' never
      deal in figures of speech as well as figures of the other sort?&rdquo; she
      wafted back to him over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very stupid,&rdquo; acknowledged Orde, following her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and faced him in the middle of the room, smiling quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo; asked Orde, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought perhaps you wanted to ask me something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your following me,&rdquo; she explained, the corners of her mouth smiling. &ldquo;I
      had turned away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just wanted to talk to you,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you always get what you want,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she conceded,
      with a shrug of mock resignation. But the four other men here cut in with
      a demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Music!&rdquo; they clamoured. &ldquo;We want music!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a nod, Miss Bishop turned to the piano, sweeping aside her white
      draperies as she sat. She struck a few soft chords, and then, her long
      hands wandering idly and softly up and down the keys, she smiled at them
      over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall it be?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one thrust an open song-book on the rack in front of her. The others
      gathered close about, leaning forward to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Song followed song, at first quickly, then at longer intervals. At last
      the members of the chorus dropped away one by one to occupations of their
      own. The girl still sat at the piano, her head thrown back idly, her hands
      wandering softly in and out of melodies and modulations. Watching her,
      Orde finally saw only the shimmer of her white figure, and the white
      outline of her head and throat. All the rest of the room was gray from the
      concentration of his gaze. At last her hands fell in her lap. She sat
      looking straight ahead of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde at once arose and came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a wonderfully quaint and beautiful thing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What was
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him, and he saw that the mocking had gone from her eyes and
      mouth, leaving them quite simple, like a child's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you like it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Orde. He hesitated and stammered awkwardly. &ldquo;It was so still
      and soothing, it made me think of the river sometimes about dusk. What was
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't anything. I was improvising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made it up yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was myself, I suppose. I love to build myself a garden, and wander on
      until I lose myself in it. I'm glad there was a river in the garden&mdash;a
      nice, still, twilight river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flashed up at him, her head sidewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't always.&rdquo; She struck a crashing discord on the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one looked up at the sudden noise of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't stop!&rdquo; they cried in chorus, as though each had been listening
      intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed up at Orde in amusement. Somehow this flash of an
      especial understanding between them to the exclusion of the others sent a
      warm glow to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish you had your harp here,&rdquo; said Jane Hubbard, coming indolently
      forward. &ldquo;You just ought to hear her play the harp,&rdquo; she told the rest.
      &ldquo;It's just the best thing you ever DID hear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the outside door opened to admit Mr and Mrs. Hubbard, who
      had, according to their usual Sunday custom, been spending the evening
      with a neighbour. This was the signal for departure. The company began to
      break up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde pushed his broad shoulders in to screen Carroll Bishop from the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you staying here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes wide at his brusqueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm visiting Jane,&rdquo; she replied at length, with an affectation of
      demureness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to be here long?&rdquo; was Orde's next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to see you,&rdquo; announced Orde. &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand, dropped it, and followed the others into the hall,
      leaving her standing by the lamp. She watched him until the outer door had
      closed behind him. Not once did he look back. Jane Hubbard, returning
      after a moment from the hall, found her at the piano again, her head
      slightly one side, playing with painful and accurate exactness a simple
      one-finger melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde walked home down the hill in company with the Incubus. Neither had
      anything to say; Orde because he was absorbed in thought, the Incubus
      because nothing occurred to draw from him his one remark. Their feet
      clipped sharply against the tar walks, or rang more hollow on the boards.
      Overhead the stars twinkled through the still-bare branches of the trees.
      With few exceptions the houses were dark. People &ldquo;retired&rdquo; early in
      Redding. An occasional hall light burned dimly, awaiting some one's
      return. At the gate of the Orde place, Orde roused himself to say
      good-night. He let himself into the dim-lighted hall, hung up his hat, and
      turned out the gas. For some time he stood in the dark, quite motionless;
      then, with the accuracy of long habitude, he walked confidently to the
      narrow stairs and ascended them. Subconsciously he avoided the creaking
      step, but outside his mother's door he stopped, arrested by a greeting
      from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you, Jack?&rdquo; queried Grandma Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Orde pushed open the door, which stood an inch or so ajar, and
      entered. A dim light from a distant street-lamp, filtered through the
      branches of a tree, flickered against the ceiling. By its aid he made out
      the great square bed, and divined the tiny figure of his mother. He seated
      himself sidewise on the edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Jane's?&rdquo; queried grandma in a low voice, to avoid awakening
      grandpa, who slept in the adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Orde, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, about the usual crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell into an abstracted silence, which endured for several minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said he abruptly, at last, &ldquo;I've met the girl I want for my
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Orde sat up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name is Carroll Bishop,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;and she's visiting Jane
      Hubbard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but WHO is she?&rdquo; insisted Grandma Orde. &ldquo;Where is she from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde stared at her in the dim light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mother,&rdquo; he repeated for the second time that day, &ldquo;blest if I know
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Orde was up and out at six o'clock the following morning. By eight he had
      reported for work at Daly's mill, where, with the assistance of a portion
      of the river crew, he was occupied in sorting the logs in the booms. Not
      until six o'clock in the evening did the whistle blow for the shut-down.
      Then he hastened home, to find that Newmark had preceded him by some few
      moments and was engaged in conversation with Grandma Orde. The young man
      was talking easily, though rather precisely and with brevity. He nodded to
      Orde and finished his remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Orde led the way up two flights of narrow stairs to his own
      room. This was among the gables, a chamber of strangely diversified
      ceiling, which slanted here and there according to the demands of the roof
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I've made up my mind to-day to go in with you. It may
      not work out, but it's a good chance, and I want to get in something that
      looks like money. I don't know who you are, nor how much of a business man
      you are or what your experience is, but I'll risk it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm putting in twenty thousand dollars,&rdquo; pointed out Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'm putting in my everlasting reputation,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;If we tell
      these fellows that we'll get out their logs for them, and then don't do
      it, I'll be DEAD around here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that's about a stand-off,&rdquo; said Newmark. &ldquo;I'm betting twenty thousand
      on what I've seen and heard of you, and you're risking your reputation
      that I don't want to drop my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I reckon we're both right,&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; Newmark pursued the subject, &ldquo;I've no objection to telling you
      about myself. New York born and bred; experience with Cooper and Dunne,
      brokers, eight years. Money from a legacy. Parents dead. No relatives to
      speak to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde nodded gravely twice in acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Newmark, &ldquo;have you had time to do any figuring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Orde, &ldquo;I got at it a little yesterday afternoon, and a
      little this noon. I have a rough idea.&rdquo; He produced a bundle of scribbled
      papers from his coat-pocket. &ldquo;Here you are. I take Daly as a sample,
      because I've been with his outfit. It costs him to run and deliver his
      logs one hundred miles about two dollars a thousand feet. He's the only
      big manufacturer up here; the rest are all at Monrovia, where they can get
      shipping by water. I suppose it costs the other nine firms doing business
      on the river from two to two and a half a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark produced a note-book and began to jot down figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do these men all conduct separate drives?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All but Proctor and old Heinzman. They pool in together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; went on Newmark, &ldquo;if we were to drive the whole river, how could we
      improve on that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven't got it down very fine, of course,&rdquo; Orde told him, &ldquo;but in
      the first place we wouldn't need so many men. I could run the river on
      three hundred easy enough. That saves wages and grub on two hundred right
      there. And, of course, a few improvements on the river would save time,
      which in our case would mean money. We would not need so many separate
      cook outfits and all that. Of course, that part of it we'd have to get
      right down and figure on, and it will take time. Then, too, if we agreed
      to sort and deliver, we'd have to build sorting booms down at Monrovia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we had all that. What, for example, do you reckon you could bring
      Daly's logs down for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde fell into deep thought, from which he emerged occasionally to
      scribble on the back of his memoranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose somewhere about a dollar,&rdquo; he announced at last. He looked up a
      trifle startled. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that looks like big money! A hundred
      per cent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark watched him for a moment, a quizzical smile wrinkling the corners
      of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your horses,&rdquo; said he at last. &ldquo;I don't know anything about this
      business, but I can see a few things. In the first place, close figuring
      will probably add a few cents to that dollar. And then, of course, all our
      improvements will be absolutely valueless to anybody after we've got
      through using them. You said yesterday they'd probably stand us in
      seventy-five thousand dollars. Even at a dollar profit, we'd have to drive
      seventy-five million before we got a cent back. And, of course, we've got
      to agree to drive for a little less than they could themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; agreed Orde, his crest falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said Newmark briskly, as he arose, &ldquo;there's good money in it,
      as you say. Now, how soon can you leave Daly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the middle of the week we ought to be through with this job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good. Then we'll go into this matter of expense thoroughly, and
      establish our schedule of rates to submit to the different firms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark said a punctilious farewell to Mr. and Mrs. Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Orde to him at the gate, &ldquo;where are you staying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Grand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know most of the people here&mdash;all the young folks. I'd be glad to
      take you around and get you acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Newmark, &ldquo;you are very kind. But I don't go in much
      for that sort of thing, and I expect to be very busy now on this new
      matter; so I won't trouble you.&rdquo;
     </p>

      The new partners, as soon as Orde had released himself from Daly, gave all
      their time to working out a schedule of tolls. Orde drew on his intimate
      knowledge of the river and its tributaries, and the locations of the
      different rollways, to estimate as closely as possible the time it would
      take to drive them. He also hunted up Tom North and others of the older
      men domiciled in the cheap boarding-houses of Hell's Half-Mile, talked
      with them, and verified his own impressions. Together, he and Newmark
      visited the supply houses, got prices, obtained lists. All the evenings
      they figured busily, until at last Newmark expressed himself as satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Orde,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here is where you come in. It's now your job to go
      out and interview these men and get their contracts for driving their next
      winter's cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Orde drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Joe,&rdquo; he objected, &ldquo;that's more in your line. You can talk
      business to them better than I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; negatived Newmark. &ldquo;They don't know me from Adam, and they do
      know you, and all about you. We've got to carry this thing through at
      first on our face, and they'd be more apt to entrust the matter to you
      personally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Orde. &ldquo;I'll start in on Daly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did so the following morning. Daly swung his bulk around in his
      revolving office-chair and listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jack,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think you're a good riverman, and I believe you
      can do it. I'd be only too glad to get rid of the nuisance of it, let
      alone get it done cheaper. If you'll draw up your contract and bring it in
      here, I'll sign it. I suppose you'll break out the rollways?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Orde; &ldquo;we hadn't thought of doing more than the driving and
      distributing. You'll have to deliver the logs in the river. Maybe another
      year, after we get better organised, we'll be able to break rollways&mdash;at
      a price per thousand&mdash;but until we get a-going we'll have to rush her
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde repeated this to his associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was smooth enough sailing,&rdquo; he exulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; pondered Newmark, removing his glasses and tapping his thumb with
      their edge. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;that was smooth sailing. What was that
      about rollways?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I told him we'd expect him to break out his own,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but what does that mean exactly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; explained Orde, with a slight stare of surprise, &ldquo;when the logs are
      cut and hauled during the winter, they are banked on the river-banks, and
      even in the river-channel itself. Then, when the thaws come in the spring,
      these piles are broken down and set afloat in the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Newmark. &ldquo;Well, but why shouldn't we undertake that part of
      it? I should think that would be more the job of the river-drivers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would hold back our drive too much to have to stop and break
      rollways,&rdquo; explained Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning they took the early train for Monrovia, where were
      situated the big mills and the offices of the nine other lumber companies.
      Within an hour they had descended at the small frame terminal station, and
      were walking together up the village street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monrovia was at that time a very spread-out little place of perhaps two
      thousand population. It was situated a half mile from Lake Michigan,
      behind the sparsely wooded sand hills of its shore. From the river, which
      had here grown to a great depth and width, its main street ran directly at
      right angles. Four brick blocks of three stories lent impressiveness to
      the vista. The stores in general, however, were low frame structures. All
      faced broad plank sidewalks raised above the street to the level of a
      waggon body. From this main street ran off, to right and left, other
      streets, rendered lovely by maple trees that fairly met across the way. In
      summer, over sidewalk and roadway alike rested a dense, refreshing dark
      shadow that seemed to throw from itself an odour of coolness. This was
      rendered further attractive by the warm spicy odour of damp pine that
      arose from the resilient surface of sawdust and shingles broken beneath
      the wheels of traffic. Back from these trees, in wide, well-cultivated
      lawns, stood the better residences. They were almost invariably built of
      many corners, with steep roofs meeting each other at all angles, with wide
      and ornamented red chimneys, numerous windows, and much scroll work
      adorning each apex and cornice. The ridge poles bristled in fancy
      foot-high palisades of wood. Chimneys were provided with lightning-rods.
      Occasionally an older structure, on square lines, recorded the era of a
      more dignified architecture. Everywhere ran broad sidewalks and picket
      fences. Beyond the better residence districts were the board shanties of
      the mill workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde and Newmark tramped up the plank walk to the farthest brick building.
      When they came to a cross street, they had to descend to it by a short
      flight of steps on one side, and ascend from it by a corresponding flight
      on the other. At the hotel, Newmark seated himself in a rocking-chair next
      the big window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde mounted a wide, dark flight of stairs that led from the street to a
      darker hall. The smell of stale cigars and cocoa matting was in the air.
      Down the dim length of this hall he made his way to a door, which without
      ceremony he pushed open.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself in a railed-off space, separated from the main part of
      the room by a high walnut grill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Heinzman in?&rdquo; he asked of a clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; replied the clerk, to whom evidently Orde was known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde spent the rest of the morning with Heinzman, a very rotund, cautious
      person of German extraction and accent. Heinzman occupied the time in
      asking questions of all sorts about the new enterprise. At twelve he had
      not in any way committed himself nor expressed an opinion. He, however,
      instructed Orde to return the afternoon of the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vill see Proctor,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde, rather exhausted, returned to find Newmark still sitting in the
      rocking-chair with his unlighted cigar. The two had lunch together, after
      which Orde, somewhat refreshed, started out. He succeeded in getting two
      more promises of contracts and two more deferred interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's going a little faster,&rdquo; he told Newmark cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning, also, he was much encouraged by the reception his
      plan gained from the other lumbermen. At lunch he recapitulated to
      Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's four contracts already,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and three more practically a
      sure thing. Proctor and Heinzman are slower than molasses about
      everything, and mean as pusley, and Johnson's up in the air, the way he
      always is, for fear some one's going to do him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a bad outlook,&rdquo; admitted Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Heinzman offered a new problem for Orde's consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haf talked with Proctor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and ve like your scheme. If you can
      deliffer our logs here for two dollars and a quarter, why, that is better
      as ve can do it; but how do ve know you vill do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll guarantee to get them here all right,&rdquo; laughed Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is your guarantee good for?&rdquo; persisted Heinzman blandly, locking
      his fingers over his rotund little stomach. &ldquo;Suppose the logs are not
      deliffered&mdash;what then? How responsible are you financially?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we're investing seventy-five thousand dollars or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman rubbed his thumb and forefinger together and wafted the imaginary
      pulverisation away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth that for a judgment,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      He allowed a pause to ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you vill give a bond for the performance of your contract,&rdquo; pursued
      Heinzman, &ldquo;that vould be satisfactory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde's mind was struck chaotic by the reasonableness of this request, and
      the utter impossibility of acceding to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much of a bond?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-fife thousand vould satisfy us,&rdquo; said Heinzman. &ldquo;Bring us a
      suitable bond for that amount and ve vill sign your contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde ran down the stairs to find Newmark. &ldquo;Heinzman won't sign unless we
      give him a bond for performance,&rdquo; he said in a low tone, as he dropped
      into the chair next to Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark removed his unlighted cigar, looked at the chewed end, and
      returned it to the corner of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heinzman has sense,&rdquo; said he drily. &ldquo;I was wondering if ordinary business
      caution was unknown out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we get such a bond? Nobody would go on my bond for that amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine either,&rdquo; said Newmark. &ldquo;We'll just have to let them go and drive
      ahead without them. I only hope they won't spread the idea. Better get
      those other contracts signed up as soon as we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this object in view, Orde started out early the next morning,
      carrying with him the duplicate contracts on which Newmark had been busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rope 'em in,&rdquo; advised Newmark. &ldquo;It's Saturday, and we don't want to let
      things simmer over Sunday, if we can help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About eleven o'clock a clerk of the Welton Lumber Co. entered Mr. Welton's
      private office to deliver to Orde a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This just came by special messenger,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde, with an apology, tore it open. It was from Heinzman, and requested
      an immediate interview. Orde delayed only long enough to get Mr. Welton's
      signature, then hastened as fast as his horse could take him across the
      drawbridge to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman he found awaiting him. The little German, with his round, rosy
      cheeks, his dot of a nose, his big spectacles, and his rotund body, looked
      even more than usual like a spider or a Santa Clause&mdash;Orde could not
      decide which.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haf been thinking of that bond,&rdquo; he began, waving a pudgy hand toward a
      seat, &ldquo;and I haf been talking with Proctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Orde hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you would not be prepared to gif a bond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, suppose ve fix him this way,&rdquo; went on Heinzman, clasping his hands
      over his stomach and beaming through his spectacles. &ldquo;Proctor and I haf
      talked it ofer, and ve are agreet that the probosition is a good one. Also
      ve think it is vell to help the young fellers along.&rdquo; He laughed silently
      in such a manner as to shake himself all over. &ldquo;Ve do not vish to be too
      severe, and yet ve must be assured that ve get our logs on time. Now, I
      unterstood you to say that this new concern is a stock company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde did not remember having said so, but he nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, if you gif us a bond secured with stock in the new company, that
      would be satisfactory to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde's face cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that, Mr. Heinzman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. Ve must haf some security, but ve do not vish to be too hard on you
      boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I call that a mighty good way out!&rdquo; cried Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your contract out according to these terms, then,&rdquo; said Heinzman,
      handing him a paper, &ldquo;and bring it in Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde glanced over the slip. It recited two and a quarter as the agreed
      price; specified the date of delivery at Heinzman and Proctor's booms;
      named twenty-five thousand dollars as the amount of the bond, to be
      secured by fifty thousand dollars' worth of stock in the new company. This
      looked satisfactory. Orde arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm much obliged to you, Mr. Heinzman,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'll bring it around
      Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had reached the gate to the grill before Heinzman called him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the vay,&rdquo; the little German beamed up at him, swinging his fat legs as
      the office-chair tipped back on its springs, &ldquo;if it is to be a stock
      company, you vill be selling some of the stock to raise money, is it not
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Orde, &ldquo;I expect so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much vill you capitalise for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We expect a hundred thousand ought to do the trick,&rdquo; replied Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; said Heinzman, &ldquo;ven you put it on the market, come and see me.&rdquo; He
      nodded paternally at Orde, beaming through his thick spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, well after six, Orde returned to the hotel. After freshening
      up in the marbled and boarded washroom, he hunted up Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Joe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I'm as hungry as a bear. Come on, eat, and I'll
      tell you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They deposited their hats on the racks and pushed open the swinging screen
      doors that led into the dining-room. There they were taken in charge by a
      marvellously haughty and redundant head-waitress, who signalled them to
      follow down through ranks of small tables watched by more stately damsels.
      Newmark, reserved and precise, irreproachably correct in his neat gray,
      seemed enveloped in an aloofness as impenetrable as that of the
      head-waitress herself. Orde, however, was as breezy as ever. He hastened
      his stride to overtake the head-waitress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie, be good!&rdquo; he said in his jolly way. &ldquo;We've got business to talk.
      Put us somewhere alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark nodded approval, and thrust his hand in his pocket. But Annie
      looked up into Orde's frank, laughing face, and her lips curved ever so
      faintly in the condescension of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, sorr,&rdquo; said she, in a most unexpected brogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've got 'em all,&rdquo; said Orde, as soon as the waitress had gone with
      the order. &ldquo;But the best stroke of business you'd never guess. I roped in
      Heinzman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; approved Newmark briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was really pretty decent of the little Dutchman. He agreed to let us
      put up our stock as security. Of course, that security is good only if we
      win out; and if we win out, why, then he'll get his logs, so he won't have
      any use for security. So it's just one way of beating the devil around the
      bush. He evidently wanted to give us the business, but he hated like the
      devil to pass up his rules&mdash;you know how those old shellbacks are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm, yes,&rdquo; said Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waitress sailed in through a violently kicked swinging door, bearing
      aloft a tin tray heaped perilously. She slanted around a corner in
      graceful opposition to the centrifugal, brought the tray to port on a sort
      of landing stage by a pillar, and began energetically to distribute small
      &ldquo;iron-ware&rdquo; dishes, each containing a dab of something. When the clash of
      arrival had died, Orde went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got into your department a little, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; asked Newmark, spearing a baked potato. &ldquo;Heinzman said he'd
      buy some of our stock. He seems to think we have a pretty good show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark paused, his potato half-way to his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of him,&rdquo; said he after a moment. &ldquo;Did he sign a contract?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't made out,&rdquo; Orde reminded him. &ldquo;I've the memoranda here. We'll
      make it out to-night. I am to bring it in Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see we're hung up here over Sunday,&rdquo; observed Newmark. &ldquo;No Sunday
      trains to Redding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde became grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. I tried to hurry matters to catch the six o'clock, but
      couldn't make it.&rdquo; His round, jolly face fell sombre, as though a light
      within had been extinguished. After a moment the light returned. &ldquo;Can't be
      helped,&rdquo; said he philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      They ate hungrily, then drifted out into the office again, where Orde lit
      a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, let's see your memoranda,&rdquo; said Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      He frowned over the three simple items for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's got me,&rdquo; he confessed at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Heinzman is up to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Orde, turning in his chair with an air of slow
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all looks queer to me. He's got something up his sleeve. Why should he
      take a bond with that security from us? If we can't deliver the logs, our
      company fails; that makes the stock worthless; that makes the bond
      worthless&mdash;just when it is needed. Of course, it's as plain as the
      nose on your face that he thinks the proposition a good one and is trying
      to get control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried Orde, astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orde, you're all right on the river,&rdquo; said Newmark, with a dry little
      laugh, &ldquo;but you're a babe in the woods at this game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Heinzman is honest,&rdquo; cried Orde. &ldquo;Why, he is a church member, and has
      a class in Sunday-school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark selected a cigar from his case, examined it from end to end,
      finally put it between his lips. The corners of his mouth were twitching
      quietly with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, he is going to buy some stock,&rdquo; added Orde, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heinzman has not the slightest intention of buying a dollar's worth of
      stock,&rdquo; asserted Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Did he make that bluff?&rdquo; finished Newmark. &ldquo;Because he wanted to
      find out how much stock would be issued. You told him it would be a
      hundred thousand dollars, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes, I believe I did,&rdquo; said Orde, pondering. Newmark threw back
      his head and laughed noiselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So now he knows that if we forfeit the bond he'll have controlling
      interest,&rdquo; he pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde smoked rapidly, his brow troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what I can't make out,&rdquo; reflected Newmark, &ldquo;is why he's so sure we'll
      have to forfeit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he's just taking a long shot at it,&rdquo; suggested Orde, who seemed
      finally to have decided against Newmark's opinion. &ldquo;I believe you're
      shying at mare's nests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he. He has some good reason for thinking we won't deliver the logs.
      Why does he insist on putting in a date for delivery? None of the others
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;Just to put some sort of a time limit on
      the thing, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you surely can get the drive through by then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure? Why, it gives me two weeks' leeway over the worst possible luck I
      could have. You're too almighty suspicious, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let me figure this out,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But bedtime found him without a solution. He retired to his room under
      fire of Orde's good-natured raillery. Orde himself shut his door, the
      smile still on his lips. As he began removing his coat, however, the smile
      died. The week had been a busy one. Hardly had he exchanged a dozen words
      with his parents, for he had even been forced to eat his dinner and supper
      away from home. This Sunday he had promised himself to make his deferred
      but much-desired call on Jane Hubbard&mdash;and her guest. He turned out
      the gas with a shrug of resignation. For the first time his brain cleared
      of its turmoil of calculations, of guesses, of estimates, and of men. He
      saw clearly the limited illumination cast downward by the lamp beneath its
      wide shade, the graceful, white figure against the shadow of the easy
      chair, the oval face cut in half by the lamplight to show plainly the red
      lips with the quaint upward quirks at the corners, and dimly the
      inscrutable eyes and the hair with the soft shadows. With a sigh he fell
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time in the night he was awakened by a persistent tapping on the
      door. In the woodsman's manner, he was instantly broad awake. He lit the
      gas and opened the door to admit Newmark, partially dressed over his night
      gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orde,&rdquo; said he briefly and without preliminary, &ldquo;didn't you tell me the
      other day that rollways were piled both on the banks and IN the river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sometimes,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they might obstruct the river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so!&rdquo; cried Newmark, with as near an approach to exultation as
      he ever permitted himself. &ldquo;Now, just one other thing: aren't Heinzman's
      rollways below most of the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe they are,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, of course, it was agreed, as usual, that Heinzman was to break out
      his own rollways?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Orde slowly. &ldquo;You think he intends to delay things enough so
      we can't deliver on the date agreed on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; stated Newmark positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he refuses to deliver the logs, no court of law will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law!&rdquo; cried Newmark. &ldquo;Refuse to deliver! You don't know that kind. He
      won't refuse to deliver. There'll just be a lot of inevitable delays, and
      his foreman will misunderstand, and all that. You ought to know more about
      that than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde nodded, his eye abstracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a child-like scheme,&rdquo; commented Newmark. &ldquo;If I'd had more knowledge
      of the business, I'd have seen it sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd never have seen it at all,&rdquo; said Orde humbly. &ldquo;You seem to be the
      valuable member of this firm, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my way,&rdquo; said Newmark, &ldquo;you in yours. We ought to make a good team.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday afternoon, Orde, leaving Newmark to devices of his own, walked
      slowly up the main street, turned to the right down one of the shaded side
      residence streets that ended finally in a beautiful glistening sand-hill.
      Up this he toiled slowly, starting at every step avalanches and streams
      down the slope. Shortly he found himself on the summit, and paused for a
      breath of air from the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was just above the tops of the maples, which seen from this angle
      stretched away like a forest through which occasionally thrust roofs and
      spires. Some distance beyond a number of taller buildings and the red of
      bricks were visible. Beyond them still were other sand-hills, planted
      raggedly with wind-twisted and stunted trees. But between the brick
      buildings and these sand-hills flowed the river&mdash;wide, deep, and
      still&mdash;bordered by the steamboat landings on the town side and by
      fishermen's huts and net-racks and small boats on the other. Orde seated
      himself on the smooth, clean sand and removed his hat. He saw these
      things, and in imagination the far upper stretches of the river, with the
      mills and yards and booms extending for miles; and still above them the
      marshes and the flats where the river widened below the Big Bend. That
      would be the location for the booms of the new company&mdash;a cheap
      property on which the partners had already secured a valuation. And below
      he dropped in imagination with the slackening current until between two
      greater sand-hills than the rest the river ran out through the channel
      made by two long piers to the lake&mdash;blue, restless, immeasurable. To
      right and left stretched the long Michigan coast, with its low yellow
      hills topped with the green of twisted pines, firs, and beeches, with
      always its beach of sand, deep and dry to the very edge of its tideless
      sea, strewn with sawlogs, bark, and the ancient remains of ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had cooled he arose and made his way back to a pleasant hardwood
      forest of maple and beech. Here the leaves were just bursting from their
      buds. Underfoot the early spring flowers&mdash;the hepaticas, the
      anemones, the trilium, the dog-tooth violets, the quaint, early,
      bright-green undergrowths&mdash;were just reaching their perfection.
      Migration was in full tide. Birds, little and big, flashed into view and
      out again, busy in the mystery of their northward pilgrimage, giving the
      appearance of secret and silent furtiveness, yet each uttering his
      characteristic call from time to time, as though for a signal to others of
      the host. The woods were swarming as city streets, yet to Orde these
      little creatures were as though invisible. He stood in the middle of a
      great multitude, he felt himself under the observation of many bright
      eyes, he heard the murmuring and twittering that proclaimed a throng, he
      sensed an onward movement that flowed slowly but steadily toward the pole;
      nevertheless, a flash of wings, a fluttering little body, the dip of a
      hasty short flight, represented the visible tokens. Across the pale silver
      sun of April their shadows flickered, and with them flickered the tracery
      of new leaves and the delicacy of the lace-like upper branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde walked slowly farther and farther into the forest, lost in an
      enjoyment which he could not have defined accurately, but which was so
      integral a portion of his nature that it had drawn him from the banks and
      wholesale groceries to the woods. After a while he sat down on a log and
      lit his pipe. Ahead the ground sloped upward. Dimly through the
      half-fronds of the early season he could make out the yellow of sands and
      the deep complementary blue of the sky above them. He knew the Lake to lie
      just beyond. With the thought he arose. A few moments later he stood on
      top the hill, gazing out over the blue waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very blue they were, with a contrasting snowy white fringe of waves
      breaking gently as far up the coast as the eye could reach. The beach, on
      these tideless waters, was hard and smooth only in the narrow strip over
      which ran the wash of the low surf. All the rest of the expanse of sand
      back to the cliff-like hills lay dry and tumbled into hummocks and drifts,
      from which projected here a sawlog cast inland from a raft by some
      long-past storm, there a slab, again a ship's rib sticking gaunt and
      defiant from the shifting, restless medium that would smother it. And just
      beyond the edge of the hard sand, following the long curves of the wash,
      lay a dark, narrow line of bark fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was very clear and crystalline. The light-houses on the ends of
      the twin piers, though some miles distant, seemed close at hand. White
      herring gulls, cruising against the blue, flashed white as the sails of a
      distant ship. A fresh breeze darkened the blue velvet surface of the
      water, tumbled the white foam hissing up the beach, blew forward over the
      dunes a fine hurrying mist of sand, and bore to Orde at last the
      refreshment of the wide spaces. A woman, walking slowly, bent her head
      against the force of this wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde watched her idly. She held to the better footing of the smooth sand,
      which made it necessary that she retreat often before the inrushing wash,
      sometimes rather hastily. Orde caught himself admiring the grace of her
      deft and sudden movements, and the sway of her willowy figure. Every few
      moments she turned and faced the lake, her head thrown back, the wind
      whipping her garments about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she drew nearer, Orde tried in vain to catch sight of her face. She
      looked down, watching the waters advance and recede; she wore a brimmed
      hat bent around her head by means of some sort of veil tied over the top
      and beneath her chin. When she had arrived nearly opposite Orde she turned
      abruptly inland, and a moment later began laboriously to climb the steep
      sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process seemed to amuse her. She turned her head sidewise to watch
      with interest the hurrying, tumbling little cascades that slid from her
      every step. From time to time she would raise her skirts daintily with the
      tips of her fingers, and lean far over in order to observe with interest
      how her feet sank to the ankles, and how the sand rushed from either side
      to fill in the depressions. The wind carried up to Orde low, joyous
      chuckles of delight, like those of a happy child.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though directed by some unseen guide, her course veered more and more
      until it led directly to the spot where Orde stood. When she was within
      ten feet of him she at last raised her head so the young man could see
      something besides the top of her hat. Orde looked plump into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; she said cheerfully and unsurprised, and sank down cross-legged
      at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde stood quite motionless, overcome by astonishment. Her face, its long
      oval framed in the bands of the gray veil and the down-turned brim of the
      hat, looked up smiling into his. The fresh air had deepened the colour
      beneath her skin and had blown loose stray locks of the fine shadow-filled
      hair. Her red lips, with the quaintly up-turned corners, smiled at him
      with a new frankness, and the black eyes&mdash;the eyes so black as to
      resemble spots&mdash;had lost their half-indolent reserve and brimmed over
      quite frankly with the joy of life. She scooped up a handful of the dry,
      clean sand from either side of her, raised it aloft, and let it trickle
      slowly between her fingers. The wind snatched at the sand and sprayed it
      away in a beautiful plume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't this REAL fun?&rdquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Bishop!&rdquo; cried Orde, finding his voice. &ldquo;What are you doing
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint shade of annoyance crossed her brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I could ask the same of you; and then we'd talk about how surprised
      we are, world without end,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The important thing is that here is
      sand to play in, and there is the Lake, and here are we, and the day is
      charmed, and it's good to be alive. Sit down and dig a hole! We've all the
      common days to explain things in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde laughed and seated himself to face her. Without further talk, and
      quite gravely, they commenced to scoop out an excavation between them,
      piling the sand over themselves and on either side as was most convenient.
      As the hole grew deeper they had to lean over more and more. Their heads
      sometimes brushed ever so lightly, their hands perforce touched. Always
      the dry sand flowed from the edges partially to fill in the result their
      efforts. Faster and faster they scooped it out again. The excavation thus
      took on the shape of a funnel. Her cheeks glowed pink, her eyes shone like
      stars. Entirely was she absorbed in the task. At last a tiny commotion
      manifested itself in the bottom of the funnel. Impulsively she laid her
      hand on Orde's, to stop them. Fascinated, they watched. After incredible
      though lilliputian upheavals, at length appeared a tiny black insect,
      struggling against the rolling, overwhelming sands. With great care the
      girl scooped this newcomer out and set him on the level ground. She looked
      up happily at Orde, thrusting the loose hair from in front of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was convinced we ought to dig a hole,&rdquo; said she gravely. &ldquo;Now, let's go
      somewhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She arose to her feet, shaking the sand free from her skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, through these woods,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;Can we get back to town this
      way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Receiving Orde's assurance, she turned at once down the slope through the
      fringe of scrub spruces and junipers into the tall woods. Here the air
      fell still. She remarked on how warm it seemed, and began to untie from
      over her ears the narrow band of veil that held close her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;The lumber-jacks say that the woods are the poor
      man's overcoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused to savour this, her head on one side, her arms upraised to the
      knot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I like that!&rdquo; said she, continuing her task. In a moment or so the
      veil hung free. She removed it and the hat, and swung them both from one
      finger, and threw back her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear all the birds!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Softly she began to utter a cheeping noise between her lips and teeth, low
      and plaintive. At once the volume of bird-sounds about increased; the
      half-seen flashes became more frequent. A second later the twigs were
      alive with tiny warblers and creepers, flirting from branch to branch,
      with larger, more circumspect chewinks, catbirds, and finches hopping down
      from above, very silent, very grave. In the depths of the thickets the
      shyer hermit and olive thrushes and the oven birds revealed themselves
      ghost-like, or as sea-growths lift into a half visibility through
      translucent shadows the colour of themselves. All were very intent, very
      earnest, very interested, each after his own manner, in the comradeship of
      the featherhood he imagined to be uttering distressful cries. A few, like
      the chickadees, quivered their wings, opened their little mouths,
      fluttered down tiny but aggressive against the disaster. Others hopped
      here and there restlessly, uttering plaintive, low-toned cheeps. The
      shyest contented themselves by a discreet, silent, and distant sympathy.
      Three or four freebooting Jays, attracted not so much by the supposed
      calls for help as by curiosity, fluttered among the tops of the trees,
      uttering their harsh notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the girl ended her performance in a musical laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run away, Brighteyes,&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;It's all right; nobody's damaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waved her hand. As though at a signal, the host she had evoked melted
      back into the shadows of the forest. Only the chickadee, impudent as ever,
      retreated scolding rather ostentatiously, and the jays, splendid in their
      ornate blue, screamed opinions at each other from the tops of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like to be a bird?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn't thought,&rdquo; replied Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you ever indulge in vain and idle speculations?&rdquo; she inquired.
      &ldquo;Never mind, don't answer. It's too much to expect of a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She set herself in idle motion down the slope, swinging the hat at the end
      of its veil, pausing to look or listen, humming a little melody between
      her closed lips, throwing her head back to breathe deep the warm air,
      revelling in the woods sounds and woods odours and woods life with entire
      self-abandonment. Orde followed her in silence. She seemed to be quite
      without responsibility in regard to him; and yet an occasional random
      remark thrown in his direction proved that he was not forgotten. Finally
      they emerged from the beach woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      They faced an open rolling country. As far as the eye could reach were the
      old stumps of pine trees. Sometimes they stood in place, burned and
      scarred, but attesting mutely the abiding place of a spirit long since
      passed away. Sometimes they had been uprooted and dragged to mark the
      boundaries of fields, where they raised an abatis of twisted roots to the
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stopped short as she came face to face with this open country.
      The inner uplift, that had lent to her aspect the wide-eyed, careless joy
      of a child, faded. In its place came a new and serious gravity. She turned
      on him troubled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do this,&rdquo; she accused him quite simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer he motioned to the left where below them lay a wide and
      cultivated countryside&mdash;farmhouses surrounded by elms; compact wood
      lots of hardwood; crops and orchards, all fair and pleasant across the
      bosom of a fertile nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That valley was once nothing but a pine forest&mdash;and
      so was all the southern part of the State, the peach belt and the farms.
      And for that matter Indiana, too, and all the other forest States right
      out to the prairies. Where would we be now, if we HADN'T done that?&rdquo; he
      pointed across at the stump-covered hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mischief had driven out the gravity from the girl's eyes. She had lowered
      her head slightly sidewise as though to conceal their expression from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was beginning to be afraid you'd say 'yes-indeed,'&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked bewildered, then remembered the Incubus, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't been very conversational,&rdquo; he acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly NOT!&rdquo; she said severely. &ldquo;That would have been very
      disappointing. There has been nothing to say.&rdquo; She turned and waved her
      hat at the beech woods falling sombre against the lowering sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said gravely, &ldquo;and pleasant dreams to you. I hope those
      very saucy little birds won't keep you awake.&rdquo; She looked up at Orde. &ldquo;He
      was rather nice to us this afternoon,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and it's always
      well to be polite to them anyway.&rdquo; She gazed steadily at Orde for signs of
      amusement. He resolutely held his face sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I think we'll go home,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made their way between the stumps to the edge of the sand-hill
      overlooking the village. With one accord they stopped. The low-slanting
      sun cast across the vista a sleepy light of evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like to live in a place like that all your life?&rdquo; asked
      Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo; She weighed her words carefully. &ldquo;It would depend. The
      place isn't of so much importance, it seems to me. It's the life one is
      called to. It's whether one finds her soul's realm or not that a place is
      liveable or not. I can imagine entering my kingdom at a railway
      water-tank,&rdquo; she said quaintly, &ldquo;or missing it entirely in a big city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked out over the raw little village with a new interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I can see how a man's work can lie in a small place,&rdquo; said he;
      &ldquo;but a woman is different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is a woman different?&rdquo; she challenged. &ldquo;What is her 'work,' as you
      call it; and why shouldn't it, as well as a man's, lie in a small place?
      What is work&mdash;outside of drudgery&mdash;unless it is correspondence
      of one's abilities to one's task?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the compensations&mdash;&rdquo; began Orde vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compensations?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What do you mean? Here are the woods and
      fields, the river, the lake, the birds, and the breezes. We'll check them
      off against the theatre and balls. Books can be had here as well as
      anywhere. As to people: in a large city you meet a great many, and they're
      all busy, and unless you make an especial and particular effort&mdash;which
      you're not likely to&mdash;you'll see them only casually and once in a
      great while. In a small place you know fewer people; but you know them
      intimately.&rdquo; She broke off with a half-laugh. &ldquo;I'm from New York,&rdquo; she
      stated humorously, &ldquo;and you've magicked me into an eloquent defense of
      Podunk!&rdquo; She laughed up at Orde quite frankly. &ldquo;Giant Strides!&rdquo; she
      challenged suddenly. She turned off the edge of the sand-hill, and began
      to plunge down its slope, leaning far back, her arms extended, increasing
      as much as possible the length of each step. Orde followed at full speed.
      When the bottom was reached, he steadied her to a halt. She shook herself,
      straightened her hat, and wound the veil around it. Her whole aspect
      seemed to have changed with the descent into the conventionality of the
      village street. The old, gentle though capable and self-contained reserve
      had returned. She moved beside Orde with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came down with Jane and Mrs. Hubbard to see Mr. Hubbard off on the boat
      for Milwaukee last night,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Of course we had to wait over
      Sunday. Mrs. Hubbard and Jane had to see some relative or other; but I
      preferred to take a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you staying?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Bennetts'. Do you know where it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said little more until the Bennetts' gate was reached. Orde declined
      to come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to thank you. You did not once act as
      though you thought I was silly or crazy. And you didn't try, as all the
      rest of them would, to act silly too. You couldn't have done it; and you
      didn't try. Oh, you may have felt it&mdash;I know!&rdquo; She smiled one of her
      quaint and quizzical smiles. &ldquo;But men aren't built for foolishness. They
      have to leave that to us. You've been very nice this afternoon; and it's
      helped a lot. I'm good for quite a long stretch now. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded to him and left him tongue-tied by the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde, however, walked back to the hotel in a black rage with himself over
      what he termed his imbecility. As he remembered it, he had made just one
      consecutive speech that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said he to Newmark, at the hotel office, &ldquo;what's the plural form of
      Incubus? I dimly remember it isn't 'busses.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incubi,&rdquo; answered Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Orde gloomily.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have Heinzman's contract all drawn,&rdquo; said Newmark the next morning,
      &ldquo;and I think I'll go around with you to the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed time they found the little German awaiting them, a rotund
      smile of false good-nature illuminating his rosy face. Orde introduced his
      partner. Newmark immediately took charge of the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have executed here the contract, and the bonds secured by Mr. Orde's
      and my shares of stock in the new company,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It is only
      necessary that you affix your signature and summon the required
      witnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman reached his hands for the papers, beaming over his glasses at the
      two young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he read, however, his smile vanished, and he looked up sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vat is this?&rdquo; he inquired, a new crispness in his voice. &ldquo;You tolt me,&rdquo;
       he accused Orde, &ldquo;dot you were not brepared to break out the rollways. You
      tolt me you would egspect me to do that for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; agreed Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, why do you put in this?&rdquo; demanded Heinzman, reading from the paper
      in his hand. &ldquo;'In case said rollways belonging to said parties of the
      second part are not broken out by the time the drive has reached them, and
      in case on demand said parties of the second part do refuse or do not
      exercise due diligence in breaking out said rollways, the said parties of
      the first part shall themselves break out said rollways, and the said
      parties of the second part do hereby agree to reimburse said parties of
      the first part at the rate of a dollar per thousand board feet.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is merely to protect ourselves,&rdquo; struck in Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; exploded Heinzman, his face purpling, &ldquo;a dollar a tousand is
      absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; agreed Newmark. &ldquo;We expect it to be. But also we expect
      you to break out your own rollways in time. It is intended as a penalty in
      case you don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vill not stand for such foolishness,&rdquo; pounded Heinzman on the arm of
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Newmark crisply, reaching for the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Heinzman clung to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is absurd,&rdquo; he repeated in a milder tone. &ldquo;See, I vill strike it out.&rdquo;
       He did so with a few dashes of the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no intention,&rdquo; stated Newmark with decision, &ldquo;of giving you the
      chance to hang up our drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman caught his breath like a child about to cry out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is what you think!&rdquo; he shouted at them. &ldquo;That's the sort of men
      you think we are! I'll show you you cannot come into honest men's offices
      to insoolt them by such insinuations!&rdquo; He tore the contract in pieces and
      threw it in the waste basket. &ldquo;Get oudt of here!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark arose as dry and precise as ever. Orde was going red and white by
      turns, and his hands twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I understand you to refuse our offer?&rdquo; asked Newmark coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refuse! Yes! You and your whole kapoodle!&rdquo; yelled Heinzman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hopped down and followed them to the grill door, repeating over and
      over that he had been insulted. The clerks stared in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once at the foot of the dark stairs and in the open street, Orde looked up
      at the sky with a deep breath of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that was a terror! We've gone off the wrong foot that
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark looked at him with some amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say that fooled you!&rdquo; he marvelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that talk about insults, and the rest of the rubbish. He saw we had
      spotted his little scheme; and he had to retreat somehow. It was as plain
      as the nose on your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; doubted Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know so. If he was mad at all, it was only at being found out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got an enemy on our hands in any case,&rdquo; concluded Newmark, &ldquo;and one
      we'll have to look out for, I don't know how he'll do it; but he'll try to
      make trouble on the river. Perhaps he'll try to block the stream by not
      breaking his rollways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the first things we'll do will be to boom through a channel where
      Mr. Man's rollways will be,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint gleam of approval lit Newmark's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you'll be equal to the occasion,&rdquo; said he drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the afternoon train, there remained four hours. The partners at
      once hunted out the little one-story frame building near the river in
      which Johnson conducted his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson received them with an evident reserve of suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no use in it,&rdquo; said he, passing his hand over his hair &ldquo;slicked&rdquo;
       down in the lumber-jack fashion. &ldquo;I can run me own widout help from any
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which seems to settle that!&rdquo; said Newmark to Orde after they had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, his drive is small; and he's behind us,&rdquo; Orde pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Newmark thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Newmark, as they trudged back to their hotel to get lunch and
      their hand-bags. &ldquo;I'll get to work at my part of it. This proposition of
      Heinzman's has given me an idea. I'm not going to try to sell this stock
      outside, but to the men who own timber along the river. Then they won't be
      objecting to the tolls; for if the company makes any profits, part will go
      to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good idea!&rdquo; cried Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take these contracts, to show we can do the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll see about incorporation. Also I'll look about and get a proper
      office and equipments, and get hold of a book-keeper. Of course we'll have
      to make this our headquarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Orde a little blankly. After an instant he laughed.
      &ldquo;Do you know, I hadn't thought of that? We'll have to live here, won't
      we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also,&rdquo; went on Newmark calmly, &ldquo;I'll buy the supplies to the best
      advantage I can, and see that they get here in good shape. I have our
      preliminary lists, and as fast as you think you need anything, send a
      requisition in to me, and I'll see to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I?&rdquo; inquired Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get right at the construction. Get the booms built and improve the
      river where it needs it. Begin to get your crew&mdash;I'm not going to
      tell you how; you know better than I do. Only get everything in shape for
      next spring's drive. You can start right off. We have my money to begin
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde laughed and stretched his arms over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My! She's a nice big job, isn't she?&rdquo; he cried joyously.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde, in spite of his activities, managed to see Carroll Bishop twice
      during the ensuing week.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return home late Monday afternoon, Grandma Orde informed him with a
      shrewd twinkle that she wanted him surely at home the following evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've asked in three or four of the young people for a candy pull,&rdquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, mother?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your crowd. The Smiths, Collinses, Jane Hubbard, and Her,&rdquo; said Grandma
      Orde, which probably went to show that she had in the meantime been making
      inquiries, and was satisfied with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose they'll care for candy pulling?&rdquo; hazarded Orde a little
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, will she?&rdquo; countered Grandma. &ldquo;Well, I hope for both your sakes
      she is not beyond a little old-fashioned fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it proved. The young people straggled in at an early hour after supper&mdash;every
      one had supper in those days. Carroll Bishop and Jane arrived nearly the
      last. Orde stepped into the hall to help them with their wraps. He was
      surprised as he approached Miss Bishop to lift her cloak from her
      shoulders, to find that the top of her daintily poised head, with its
      soft, fine hair, came well below the level of his eyes. Somehow her poise,
      her slender grace of movement and of attitude, had lent her the impression
      of a stature she did not possess. To-night her eyes, while fathomless as
      ever, shone quietly in anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she told Orde delightedly, &ldquo;I have never been to a real
      candy pull in my life. It was so good of your mother to ask me. What a
      dear she looks to-night. And is that your father? I'm going to speak to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned through the narrow door into the lighted, low-ceilinged parlour
      where the company were chatting busily. Orde mechanically followed her. He
      was arrested by the sound of Jane Hubbard's slow good-humoured voice
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Jack,&rdquo; she drawled, &ldquo;I agree with you perfectly; but that is NO
      reason why I should be neglected entirely. Come and hang up my coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Full of remorse, Orde turned. Jane Hubbard stood accusingly in the middle
      of the hall, her plain, shrewd, good-humoured face smiling faintly. Orde
      met her frank wide eyes with some embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Jane, holding out the coat. &ldquo;I don't much care whether
      you hang it up or not. I just wanted to call you back to wish you luck.&rdquo;
       Her slow smile widened, and her gray eyes met his still more knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde seized the coat and her hand at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane, you're a trump,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No wonder you're the most popular girl
      in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am, Jack,&rdquo; she agreed indolently. She entered the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candy pulling was a success. Of course everybody got burned a little
      and spattered a good deal; but that was to be expected. After the product
      had been broken and been piled on dishes, all trooped to the informal
      &ldquo;back sitting-room,&rdquo; where an open fire invited to stories and games of
      the quieter sort. Some of the girls sat in chairs, though most joined the
      men on the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll Bishop, however, seemed possessed of a spirit of restlessness. The
      place seemed to interest her. She wandered here and there in the room,
      looking now at the walnut-framed photograph of Uncle Jim Orde, now at the
      great pink conch shells either side the door, now at the marble-topped
      table with its square paper-weight of polished agate and its glass &ldquo;bell,&rdquo;
       beneath which stood a very life-like robin. This &ldquo;back sitting-room&rdquo;
       contained little in the way of ornament. It was filled, on the contrary,
      with old comfortable chairs, and worn calf-backed books. The girl peered
      at the titles of these; but the gas-jets had been turned low in favour of
      the firelight, and she had to give over the effort to identify the
      volumes. Once she wandered close to Grandma Orde's cushioned wooden
      rocker, and passed her hand lightly over the old lady's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind if I look at things?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It's so dear and sweet and
      old and different from our New York homes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look all you want to, dearie,&rdquo; said Grandma Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment she passed into the dining-room. Here Orde found her, her
      hands linked in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is so quaint and delightful,&rdquo; she exhaled slowly. &ldquo;This dear, dear
      old house with its low ceilings and its queer haphazard lines, and its
      deep windows, and its old pictures, and queer unexpected things that take
      your breath away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one of the oldest houses in town,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;and I suppose it is
      picturesque. But, you see, I was brought up here, so I'm used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until you leave it,&rdquo; said she prophetically, &ldquo;and live away from it.
      Then all these things will come back to you to make your heart ache for
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rambled about together, Orde's enthusiasm gradually kindling at the
      flame of her own. He showed her the marvellous and painstaking pencil
      sketch of Napoleon looking out over a maltese-cross sunset done by Aunt
      Martha at the age of ten. It hung framed in the upper hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has always been there, ever since I can remember,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;and it
      has seemed to belong there. I've never thought of it as good or bad, just
      as belonging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this spirit also they viewed the plaster statue of Washington in the
      lower hall, and the Roger's group in the parlour. The glass cabinet of
      &ldquo;curiosities&rdquo; interested her greatly&mdash;the carved ivory chessmen, the
      dried sea-weeds, the stone from Sugar Loaf Rock, the bit from the wreck of
      the NORTH STAR, the gold and silver shells, the glittering geodes and
      pyrites, the sandal-wood fan, and all the hundred and one knick-knacks it
      was then the custom to collect under glass. They even ventured part way up
      the creaky attic stairs, but it was too dark to enter that mysterious
      region.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear the drip of water,&rdquo; she whispered, her finger on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the tank,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has it a Dark Place behind it?&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just what it has,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;tell me&mdash;are there real hair trunks with brass knobs on
      'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother has two or three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-o-h!&rdquo; she breathed softly. &ldquo;Don't tell me what's in them. I want to
      believe in brocades and sashes. Do you know,&rdquo; she looked at him soberly,
      &ldquo;I never had any dark places behind the tank, nor mysterious trunks, when
      I was a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might begin now,&rdquo; suggested Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to insinuate I haven't grown up?&rdquo; she mocked. &ldquo;Thank you!
      Look OUT!&rdquo; she cried suddenly, &ldquo;the Boojum will catch us,&rdquo; and picking up
      her skirts she fairly flew down the narrow stairs. Orde could hear the
      light swish of her draperies down the hall, and then the pat of her feet
      on the stair carpet of the lower flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed rather dreamily. A glance into the sitting-room showed the
      group gathered close around the fire listening to Lem Collin's attempt at
      a ghost story. She was not there. He found her, then, in the parlour. She
      was kneeling on the floor before the glass cabinet of curiosities, and she
      had quite flattened her little nose against the pane. At his exclamation
      she looked up with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the proper altitude from which to view a cabinet of curiosities,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;and something tells me you ought to flatten your nose, too.&rdquo;
       She held out both hands to be helped up. &ldquo;Oh, WHAT a house for a child!&rdquo;
       she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the company had gone, Orde stood long by the front gate looking up
      into the infinite spaces. Somehow, and vaguely, he felt the night to be
      akin to her elusive spirit. Farther and farther his soul penetrated into
      its depths; and yet other depths lay beyond, other mysteries, other
      unguessed realms. And yet its beauty was the simplicity of space and dark
      and the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time he saw her was at her own house&mdash;or rather the house of
      the friend she visited. Orde went to call on Friday evening and was lucky
      enough to find the girls home and alone. After a decent interval Jane made
      an excuse and went out. They talked on a great variety of subjects, and
      with a considerable approach toward intimacy. Not until nearly time to go
      did Orde stumble upon the vital point of the evening. He had said
      something about a plan for the week following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you forget that by that time I shall be gone,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he echoed blankly. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Don't you remember I am to go Sunday morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were going to stay a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was, but I&mdash;certain things came up that made it necessary for me
      to leave sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I'm sorry you're going,&rdquo; stammered Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I've had a very nice time here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I won't see you again,&rdquo; said Orde, still groping for realisation. &ldquo;I
      must go to Monrovia to-morrow. But I'll be down to see you off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not to be for good?&rdquo; he expostulated. &ldquo;You'll be coming back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw her hands palm out, with a pretty gesture of ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is in the lap of the gods,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you write me occasionally?&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that&mdash;&rdquo; she began&mdash;&ldquo;I'm a very poor correspondent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But won't you write?&rdquo; he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not make it a custom to write to young men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he cried, believing himself enlightened. &ldquo;Will you answer if I write
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On whether there is a reply to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But may I write you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I couldn't very well prevent you, if you were sure to put on a
      three-cent stamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to?&rdquo; persisted Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began gently to laugh, quite to herself, as though enjoying a joke
      entirely within her own personal privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so direct and persistent and boy-like,&rdquo; said she presently. &ldquo;Now
      if you'll be very good, and not whisper to the other little pupils, I'll
      tell you how they do such things usually.&rdquo; She sat up straight from the
      depths of her chair, her white, delicately tapering forearms resting
      lightly on her knees. &ldquo;Young men desiring to communicate with young ladies
      do not ask them bluntly. They make some excuse, like sending a book, a
      magazine, a marked newspaper, or even a bit of desired information. At the
      same time, they send notes informing the girl of the fact. The girl is
      naturally expected to acknowledge the politeness. If she wishes the
      correspondence to continue, she asks a question, or in some other way
      leaves an opening. Do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; said Orde, slightly crestfallen. &ldquo;But that's a long time to
      wait. I like to feel settled about a thing. I wanted to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped back against the cushioned slant of her easy chair, and
      laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you just up and asked!&rdquo; she teased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon if I was rude,&rdquo; he said humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laughter died slowly from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It would be asking pardon for being yourself. You
      wanted to know: so you asked. And I'm going to answer. I shall be very
      glad to correspond with you and tell you about my sort of things, if you
      happen to be interested in them. I warn you: they are not very exciting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are yours,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She half rose to bow in mock graciousness, caught herself, and sank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't,&rdquo; she said, more than half to herself. She sat brooding for a
      moment; then suddenly her mood changed. She sprang up, shook her skirts
      free, and seated herself at the piano. To Orde, who had also arisen, she
      made a quaint grimace over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admire your handiwork!&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;You are rapidly bringing me to
      'tell the truth and shame the devil.' Oh, he must be dying of
      mortification this evening!&rdquo; She struck a great crashing chord, holding
      the keys while the strings reverberated and echoed down slowly into
      silence again. &ldquo;It isn't fair,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;for you big simple men to
      disarm us. I don't care! I have my private opinion of such brute strength.
      JE ME MOQUE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrinkled her nose and narrowed her eyes. Then ruthlessly she drowned
      his reply in a torrent of music. Like mad she played, rocking her slender
      body back and forth along the key-board; holding rigid her fingers, her
      hands, and the muscles of her arms. The bass notes roared like the
      rumbling of thunder; the treble flashed like the dart of lightnings.
      Abruptly she muted the instrument. Silence fell as something that had been
      pent and suddenly released. She arose from the piano stool quite
      naturally, both hands at her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't Mr. and Mrs. Hubbard dear old people?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your address in New York?&rdquo; demanded Orde. She sank into a chair
      nearby with a pretty uplifted gesture of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I surrender!&rdquo; she cried, and then she laughed until the tears started
      from her eyes and she had to brush them away with what seemed to Orde an
      absurd affair to call a handkerchief. &ldquo;Oh, you are delicious!&rdquo; she said at
      last. &ldquo;Well, listen. I live at 12 West Ninth Street. Can you remember
      that?&rdquo; Orde nodded. &ldquo;And now any other questions the prisoner can reply to
      without incriminating herself, she is willing to answer.&rdquo; She folded her
      hands demurely in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later Orde saw the train carry her away. He watched the rear car
      disappear between the downward slopes of two hills, and then finally the
      last smoke from the locomotive dissipate in the clear blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Declining Jane's kindly meant offer of a lift, he walked back to town.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The new firm plunged busily into its more pressing activities. Orde
      especially had an infinitude of details on his hands. The fat note-book in
      his side pocket filled rapidly with rough sketches, lists, and estimates.
      Constantly he interviewed men of all kinds&mdash;rivermen, mill men,
      contractors, boat builders, hardware dealers, pile-driver captains,
      builders, wholesale grocery men, cooks, axe-men, chore boys&mdash;all a
      little world in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signs of progress soon manifested themselves. Below Big Bend the
      pile-drivers were at work, the square masses of their hammers rising
      rapidly to the tops of the derricks, there to pause a moment before
      dropping swiftly to a dull THUMP! They were placing a long, compact row,
      which should be the outer bulwarks separating the sorting-booms from the
      channel of the river. Ashore the carpenters were knocking together a long,
      low structure for the cook-house and a larger building, destined to serve
      as bunk-house for the regular boom-crew. There would also be a
      blacksmith's forge, a storehouse, a tool and supply-house, a barn, and
      small separate shanties for the married men. Below more labourers with
      picks, shovels, axes, and scrapers were cutting out and levelling a road
      which would, when finished, meet the county road to town. The numerous
      bayous of great marsh were crossed by &ldquo;float-bridges,&rdquo; lying flat on the
      surface of the water, which spurted up in rhythmical little jets under the
      impact of hoofs. Down stream eight miles, below the mills, and just beyond
      where the drawbridge crossed over to Monrovia, Duncan McLeod's shipyards
      clipped and sawed, and steamed and bent and bolted away at two tugboats,
      the machinery for which was already being stowed in the hold of a vessel
      lying at wharf in Chicago. In the storerooms of hardware firms porters
      carried and clerks checked off chains, strap iron, bolts, spikes, staples,
      band iron, bar iron, peavies, cant-hooks, pike-poles, sledge-hammers,
      blocks, ropes, and cables.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things took time and attention to details; also a careful
      supervision. The spring increased, burst into leaf and bloom, and settled
      into summer. Orde was constantly on the move. As soon as low water came
      with midsummer, however, he arranged matters to run themselves as far as
      possible, left with Newmark minute instructions as to personal
      supervision, and himself departed to Redding. Here he joined a crew which
      Tom North had already collected, and betook himself to the head of the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew exactly what he intended to do. Far back on the head-waters he
      built a dam. The construction of it was crude, consisting merely of log
      cribs filled with stone and debris placed at intervals across the bed of
      the stream, against which slanted logs made a face. The gate operated
      simply, and could be raised to let loose an entire flood. And indeed this
      was the whole purpose of the dam. It created a reservoir from which could
      be freed new supplies of water to eke out the dropping spring freshets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having accomplished this formidable labour&mdash;for the trees had to be
      cut and hauled, the stone carted, and the earth shovelled&mdash;the crew
      next moved down a good ten miles to where the river dropped over a rapids
      rough and full of boulders. Here were built and placed a row of
      stone-filled log cribs in a double row down stream to define the channel
      and to hold the drive in it and away from the shallows near either bank.
      The profile of these cribs was that of a right-angled triangle, the
      slanting side up stream. Booms chained between them helped deflect the
      drive from the shoals. Their more important office, however, was to give
      footing to the drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For twenty-five miles then nothing of importance was undertaken. Two or
      three particularly bad boulders were split out by the explosion of powder
      charges; a number of snags and old trees were cut away and disposed of;
      the channel was carefully examined for obstructions of any kind whatever.
      Then the party came to the falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Orde purposed his most elaborate bit of rough engineering. The falls
      were only about fifteen feet high, but they fell straight down to a bed of
      sheer rock. This had been eaten by the eddies into pot-holes and crannies
      until a jagged irregular scoop-hollow had formed immediately underneath
      the fall. Naturally this implied a ledge below.
    </p>
    <p>
      In flood time the water boiled and roared through this obstruction in a
      torrent. The saw logs, caught in the rush, plunged end on into the
      scoop-hollow, hit with a crash, and were spewed out below more or less
      battered, barked, and stripped. Sometimes, however, when the chance of the
      drive brought down a hundred logs together, they failed to shoot over the
      barrier of the ledge. Then followed a jam, a bad jam, difficult and
      dangerous to break. The falls had taken her usurious share of the lives
      the river annually demands as her toll.
    </p>
    <p>
      This condition of affairs Orde had determined, if possible, to obviate.
      From the thirty-five or forty miles of river that lay above, and from its
      tributaries would come the bulk of the white and Norway pine for years to
      follow. At least two thirds of each drive Orde figured would come from
      above the fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said he to North, &ldquo;we could carry an apron on a slant from just
      under the crest and over the pot-holes, it would shoot both the water and
      the logs off a better angle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed North, &ldquo;but you'll have fun placing your apron with all
      that water running through. Why, it would drown us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a notion on that,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;First thing is to get the
      material together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hardwood forest topped the slope. Into this went the axe-men. The
      straightest trees they felled, trimmed, and dragged, down travoy trails
      they constructed, on sleds they built for the purpose, to the banks of the
      river. Here they bored the two holes through either end to receive the
      bolts when later they should be locked together side by side in their
      places. As fast as they were prepared, men with cant-hooks rolled them
      down the slope to a flat below the falls. They did these things swiftly
      and well, because they were part of the practised day's work, but they
      shook their heads at the falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the trees had been cut in sufficient number&mdash;there were
      seventy-five of them, each twenty-six feet long&mdash;Orde led the way
      back up stream a half mile to a shallows, where he commanded the
      construction of a number of exaggerated sawhorses with very widespread
      slanting legs. In the meantime the cook-wagon and the bed-wagon had
      evidently been making many trips to Sand Creek, fifteen miles away, as was
      attested by a large pile of heavy planks. When the sawhorses were
      completed, Orde directed the picks and shovels to be brought up.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the river, as has been hinted, widened over shoals. The
      banks at either hand, too, were flat and comparatively low. As is often
      the case in bends of rivers subject to annual floods, the banks sloped
      back for some distance into a lower black-ash swamp territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde set his men to digging a channel through this bank. It was no slight
      job, from one point of view, as the slope down into the swamp began only
      at a point forty or fifty feet inland; but on the other hand the earth was
      soft and free from rocks. When completed the channel gave passage to a
      rather feeble streamlet from the outer fringe of the river. The men were
      puzzled, but Orde, by the strange freak of his otherwise frank and open
      nature, as usual told nothing of his plans, even to Tom North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can't expect to turn that river,&rdquo; said Tim Nolan, who was once more
      with the crew. &ldquo;He'd have to dig a long ways below that level to catch the
      main current&mdash;and then some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; advised North, puffing at his short pipe. &ldquo;He's wiser
      than a tree full of owls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next Orde assigned two men to each of the queer-shaped sawhorses, and
      instructed them to place the horses in a row across the shallowest part of
      the river, and broadside to the stream. This was done. The men, half-way
      to their knees in the swift water, bore down heavily to keep their charges
      in place. Other men immediately began to lay the heavy planks side by
      side, perpendicular to and on the up-stream side of the horses. The weight
      of the water clamped them in place; big rocks and gravel shovelled on in
      quantity prevented the lower ends from rising; the wide slant of the legs
      directed the pressure so far downward that the horses were prevented from
      floating away. And slowly the bulk of the water, thus raised a good three
      feet above its former level, turned aside into the new channel and poured
      out to inundate the black-ash swamp beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good volume still poured over the top of the temporary dam and down to
      the fall; but it was by this expedient so far reduced that work became
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys!&rdquo; cried Orde. &ldquo;Lively, while we've got the chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By means of blocks and tackles and the team horses the twenty-six-foot
      logs were placed side by side, slanting from a point two feet below the
      rim of the fall to the ledge below. They were bolted together top and
      bottom through the four holes bored for that purpose. This was a confusing
      and wet business. Sufficient water still flowed in the natural channel of
      the river to dash in spray over the entire work. Men toiled, wet to the
      skin, their garments clinging to them, their eyes full of water, barely
      able to breathe, yet groping doggedly at it, and arriving at last. The
      weather was warm with the midsummer. They made a joke of the difficulty,
      and found inexhaustible humour in the fact that one of their number was an
      Immersion Baptist. When the task was finished, they pried the flash-boards
      from the improvised dam; piled them neatly beyond reach of high water;
      rescued the sawhorses and piled them also for a possible future use;
      blocked the temporary channel with a tree or so&mdash;and earth. The
      river, restored to its immemorial channel by these men who had so
      nonchalantly turned it aside, roared on, singing again the song it had
      until now sung uninterruptedly for centuries. Orde and his crew tramped
      back to the falls, and gazed on their handiwork with satisfaction. Instead
      of plunging over an edge into a turmoil of foam and eddies, now the water
      flowed smoothly, almost without a break, over an incline of thirty
      degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Logs'll slip over that slick as a gun barrel,&rdquo; said Tom North. &ldquo;How long
      do you think she'll last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't an idea,&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;We may have to do it again next summer,
      but I don't think it. There's nothing but the smooth of the water to wear
      those logs until they begin to rot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite cheerfully they took up their long, painstaking journey back down
      the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travel down the river was at times very pleasant, and at times very
      disagreeable. The ground had now hardened so that a wanigan boat was
      unnecessary. Instead, the camp outfit was transported in waggons, which
      often had to journey far inland, to make extraordinary detours, but which
      always arrived somehow at the various camping places. Orde and his men, of
      course, took the river trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river trail ran almost unbroken for over a hundred miles of meandering
      way. It climbed up the high banks at the points, it crossed the bluffs
      along their sheer edges, it descended to the thickets in the flats, it
      crossed the swamps on pole-trails, it skirted the great, solemn woods.
      Sometimes, in the lower reaches, its continuity was broken by a town, but
      always after it recovered from its confusion it led on with purpose
      unvarying. Never did it desert for long the river. The cool, green still
      reaches, or the tumbling of the white-water, were always within its sight,
      sometimes beneath its very tread. When occasionally it cut in across a
      very long bend, it always sent from itself a little tributary trail which
      traced all the curves, and returned at last to its parent, undoubtedly
      with a full report of its task. And the trail was beaten hard by the feet
      of countless men, who, like Orde and his crew, had taken grave, interested
      charge of the river from her birth to her final rest in the great expanses
      of the Lake. It is there to-day, although the life that brought it into
      being has been gone from it these many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In midsummer Orde found the river trail most unfamiliar in appearance.
      Hardly did he recognise it in some places. It possessed a wide, leisurely
      expansiveness, an indolent luxury, a lazy invitation born of broad green
      leaves, deep and mysterious shadows, the growth of ferns, docks, and the
      like cool in the shade of the forest, the shimmer of aspens and poplars
      through the heat, the green of tangling vines, the drone of insects, the
      low-voiced call of birds, the opulent splashing of sun-gold through the
      woods, quite lacking to the hard, tight season in which his river work was
      usually performed. What, in the early year, had been merely a whip of
      brush, now had become a screen through whose waving, shifting interstices
      he caught glimpses of the river flowing green and cool. What had been bare
      timber amongst whose twigs and branches the full daylight had shone
      unobstructed, now had clothed itself in foliage and leaned over to make
      black and mysterious the water that flowed beneath. Countless insects
      hovered over the polished surface of that water. Dragon-flies cruised
      about. Little birds swooped silently down and fluttered back, intent on
      their tiny prey. Water-bugs skated hither and thither in apparently
      purposeless diagonals. Once in a great while the black depths were
      stirred. A bass rolled lazily over, carrying with him his captured insect,
      leaving on the surface of the water concentric rings which widened and
      died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trail led the crew through many minor labours, all of which consumed
      time. At Reed's Mill Orde entered into diplomatic negotiations with Old
      Man Reed, whom he found singularly amenable. The skirmish in the spring
      seemed to have taken all the fight out of him; or perhaps, more simply,
      Orde's attitude toward him at that time had won him over to the young
      man's side. At any rate, as soon as he understood that Orde was now in
      business for himself, he readily came to an agreement. Thereupon Orde's
      crew built a new sluiceway and gate far enough down to assure a good head
      in the pond above. Other dam owners farther down the stream also signed
      agreements having to do with supplying water over and above what the law
      required of them. Above one particularly shallow rapid Orde built a dam of
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this took time, and the summer months slipped away. Orde had fallen
      into the wild life as into a habit. He lived on the river or the trail.
      His face took on a ruddier hue than ever; his clothes faded to a
      nondescript neutral colour of their own; his hair below his narrow felt
      hat bleached three shades. He did his work, and figured on his schemes,
      and smoked his pipe, and occasionally took little trips to the nearest
      town, where he spent the day at the hotel desks reading and answering his
      letters. The weather was generally very warm. Thunder-storms were not
      infrequent. Until the latter part of August, mosquitoes and black flies
      were bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the middle of September the crew had worked down as far as Redding,
      leaving behind them a river tamed, groomed, and harnessed for their uses.
      Remained still the forty miles between Redding and the Lake to be
      improved. As, however, navigation for light draught vessels extended as
      far as that city, Orde here paid off his men. A few days' work with a pile
      driver would fence the principal shoals from the channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed over night with his parents, and at once took the train for
      Monrovia. There he made his way immediately to the little office the new
      firm had rented. Newmark had just come down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Joe,&rdquo; greeted Orde, his teeth flashing in contrast to the tan of
      his face. &ldquo;I'm done. Anything new since you wrote last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark had acquired his articles of incorporation and sold his stock. How
      many excursions, demonstrations, representations, and arguments that
      implied, only one who has undertaken the floating of a new and untried
      scheme can imagine. Perhaps his task had in it as much of difficulty as
      Orde's taming of the river. Certainly he carried it to as successful a
      conclusion. The bulk of the stock he sold to the log-owners themselves;
      the rest he scattered here and there and everywhere in small lots, as he
      was able. Some five hundred and thousand dollar blocks even went to
      Chicago. His own little fortune of twenty thousand he paid in for the
      shares that represented his half of the majority retained by himself and
      Orde. The latter gave a note at ten per cent for his proportion of the
      stock. Newmark then borrowed fifteen thousand more, giving as security a
      mortgage on the company's newly acquired property&mdash;the tugs, booms,
      buildings, and real estate. Thus was the financing determined. It left the
      company with obligations of fifteen hundred dollars a year in interest,
      expenses which would run heavily into the thousands, and an obligation to
      make good outside stock worth at par exactly forty-nine thousand dollars.
      In addition, Orde had charged against his account a burden of two thousand
      dollars a year interest on his personal debt. To offset these liabilities&mdash;outside
      the river improvements and equipments, which would hold little or no value
      in case of failure&mdash;the firm held contracts to deliver about one
      hundred million feet of logs. After some discussion the partners decided
      to allow themselves twenty-five hundred dollars apiece by way of salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we don't make any dividends at first,&rdquo; Orde pointed out, &ldquo;I've got to
      keep even on my interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't live on five hundred,&rdquo; objected Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be on the river and at the booms six months of the year,&rdquo; replied
      Orde, &ldquo;and I can't spend much there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm satisfied,&rdquo; said Newmark thoughtfully, &ldquo;I'm getting a little better
      than good interest on my own investment from the start. And in a few years
      after we've paid up, there'll be mighty big money in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He removed his glasses and tapped his palm with their edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only point that is at all risky to me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is that we have
      only one-season contracts. If for any reason we hang up the drive, or fail
      to deliver promptly, we're going to get left the year following. And then
      it's B-U-S-T, bust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll just try not to hang her,&rdquo; replied Orde.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde's bank account, in spite of his laughing assertion to Newmark,
      contained some eleven hundred dollars. After a brief but comprehensive
      tour of inspection over all the works then forward, he drew a hundred of
      this and announced to Newmark that business would take him away for about
      two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some private affairs to attend to before settling down to business
      for keeps,&rdquo; he told Newmark vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Redding, whither he went to pack his little sole-leather trunk, he told
      Grandma Orde the same thing. She said nothing at the time, but later, when
      Grandpa Orde's slender figure had departed, very courteous, very erect,
      very dignified, with its old linen duster flapping around it, she came and
      stood by the man leaning over the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak to her, Jack,&rdquo; said she quietly. &ldquo;She cares for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked up in astonishment, but he did not pretend to deny the implied
      accusation as to his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mother!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She's only seen me three or four times! It's
      absurd&mdash;yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; nodded Grandma Orde, wisely. &ldquo;I know. But you mark my words; she
      cares for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing more, but stood looking while Orde folded and laid away,
      his head bent low in thought. Then she placed her hand for an instant on
      his shoulder and went away. The Ordes were not a demonstrative people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey to New York was at that time very long and disagreeable, but
      Orde bore it with his accustomed stoicism. He had visited the metropolis
      before, so it was not unfamiliar to him. He was very glad, however, to get
      away from the dust and monotony of the railroad train. The September
      twilight was just falling. Through its dusk the street lamps were popping
      into illumination as the lamp-lighter made his rapid way. Orde boarded a
      horse-car and jingled away down Fourth Avenue. He was pleased at having
      arrived, and stretched his legs and filled his lungs twice with so evident
      an enjoyment that several people smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      His comfort was soon disturbed, however, by an influx of people boarding
      the car at Twenty-third Street. The seats were immediately filled, and
      late comers found themselves obliged to stand in the aisle. Among these
      were several women. The men nearest buried themselves in the papers after
      the almost universal metropolitan custom. Two or three arose to offer
      their seats, among them Orde. When, however, the latter had turned to
      indicate to one of the women the vacated seat, he discovered it occupied
      by a chubby and flashily dressed youth of the sort common enough in the
      vicinity of Fourteenth Street; impudent of eye, cynical of demeanour, and
      slightly contemptuous of everything unaccustomed. He had slipped in back
      of Orde when that young man arose, whether under the impression that Orde
      was about to get off the car or from sheer impudence, it would be
      impossible to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde stared at him, a little astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intended that seat for this lady,&rdquo; said Orde, touching him on the
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth looked up coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't come that!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde wasted no time in discussion, which no doubt saved the necessity of a
      more serious disturbance. He reached over suddenly, seized the youth by
      the collar, braced his knee against the seat, and heaved the interloper so
      rapidly to his feet that he all but plunged forward among the passengers
      sitting opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your seat, madam,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman, frightened, unwilling to become the participant of a scene of
      any sort, stood looking here and there. Orde, comprehending her
      embarrassment, twisted his antagonist about, and, before he could recover
      his equilibrium sufficiently to offer resistance, propelled him rapidly to
      the open door, the passengers hastily making way for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my friend,&rdquo; said Orde, releasing his hold on the other's collar,
      &ldquo;don't do such things any more. They aren't nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trivial as the incident was, it served to draw Orde to the particular
      notice of an elderly man leaning against the rear rail. He was a very
      well-groomed man, dressed in garments whose fit was evidently the product
      of the highest art, well buttoned up, well brushed, well cared for in
      every way. In his buttonhole he wore a pink carnation, and in his gloved
      hand he carried a straight, gold-headed cane. A silk hat covered his head,
      from beneath which showed a slightly empurpled countenance, with bushy
      white eyebrows, a white moustache, and a pair of rather bloodshot, but
      kindly, blue eyes. In spite of his somewhat pudgy rotundity, he carried
      himself quite erect, in a manner that bespoke the retired military man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have courage, sir,&rdquo; said this gentleman, inclining his bead gravely
      to Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man laughed in his good-humoured fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much courage required to root out that kind of a skunk,&rdquo; said he
      cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refer to the courage of your convictions. The young men of this
      generation seem to prefer to avoid public disturbances. That breed is
      quite capable of making a row, calling the police, raising the deuce, and
      all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elderly gentleman puffed out his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are from the West, are you not?&rdquo; he stated, rather than asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We call it the East out there,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;It's Michigan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should call that pretty far west,&rdquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more was said. After a block or two Orde descended on his way to a
      small hotel just off Broadway. The old gentleman saluted. Orde nodded
      good-humouredly. In his private soul he was a little amused at the old
      boy. To his view a man and clothes carried to their last refinement were
      contradictory terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde ate, dressed, and set out afoot in search of Miss Bishop's address.
      He arrived in front of the house a little past eight o'clock, and, after a
      moment's hesitation, mounted the steps and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door swung silently back to frame an impassive man-servant dressed in
      livery. To Orde's inquiry he stated that Miss Bishop had gone out to the
      theatre. The young man left his name and a message of regret. At this the
      footman, with an irony so subtle as to be quite lost on Orde, demanded a
      card. Orde scribbled a line in his note-book, tore it out, folded it, and
      left it. In it he stated his regret, his short residence in the city, and
      desired an early opportunity to call. Then he departed down the brownstone
      steps, totally unconscious of the contempt he had inspired in the heart of
      the liveried man behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He retired early and arose early, as had become his habit. When he
      descended to the office the night clerk, who had not yet been relieved,
      handed him a note delivered the night before. Orde ripped it open eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR MR. ORDE:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so sorry to miss you that evening because of a stupid play. Come
      around as early as you can to-morrow morning. I shall expect you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sincerely yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CARROLL BISHOP.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde glanced at the clock, which pointed to seven. He breakfasted, read
      the morning paper, finally started leisurely in the direction of West
      Ninth Street. He walked slowly, so as to consume more time, then at
      University Place was seized with a panic, and hurried rapidly to his
      destination. The door was answered by the same man who had opened the
      night before, but now, in some indefinable way, his calm, while flawless
      externally, seemed to have lifted to a mere surface, as though he might
      hastily have assumed his coat. To Orde's inquiry he stated with great
      brevity that Miss Bishop was not yet visible, and prepared to close the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said Orde, with equal brevity, and stepped inside. &ldquo;I
      have an engagement with Miss Bishop. Tell her Mr. Orde is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man departed in some doubt, leaving Orde standing in the gloomy hall.
      That young man, however, quite cheerfully parted the heavy curtains
      leading into a parlour, and sat down in a spindle-legged chair. At his
      entrance, a maid disappeared out another door, carrying with her the
      implements of dusting and brushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked around the room with some curiosity. It was long, narrow, and
      very high. Tall windows admitted light at one end. The illumination was,
      however, modified greatly by hangings of lace covering all the windows,
      supplemented by heavy draperies drawn back to either side. The embrasure
      was occupied by a small table, over which seemed to flutter a beautiful
      marble Psyche. A rubber plant, then as now the mark of the city and
      suburban dweller, sent aloft its spare, shiny leaves alongside a closed
      square piano. The lack of ornaments atop the latter bespoke the musician.
      Through the filtered gloom of the demi-light Orde surveyed with interest
      the excellent reproductions of the Old World masterpieces framed on the
      walls&mdash;&ldquo;Madonnas&rdquo; by Raphael, Murillo, and Perugino, the &ldquo;Mona Lisa,&rdquo;
       and Botticelli's &ldquo;Spring&rdquo;&mdash;the three oil portraits occupying the
      large spaces; the spindle-legged chairs and tables, the tea service in the
      corner, the tall bronze lamp by the piano, the neat little grate-hearth,
      with its mantel of marble; the ormolu clock, all the decorous and
      decorated gentility which marked the irreproachable correctness of whoever
      had furnished the apartment. Dark and heavy hangings depended in front of
      a double door leading into another room beyond. Equally dark and heavy
      hangings had closed behind Orde as he entered. An absolute and shrouded
      stillness seemed to settle down upon him. The ormolu clock ticked
      steadily. Muffled sounds came at long intervals from behind the portieres.
      Orde began to feel oppressed and subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      For quite three quarters of an hour he waited without hearing any other
      indications of life than the muffled sounds just remarked upon.
      Occasionally he shifted his position, but cautiously, as though he feared
      to awaken some one. The three oil portraits stared at him with all the
      reserved aloofness of their painted eyes. He began to doubt whether the
      man had announced him at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, breaking the stillness with almost startling abruptness, he heard a
      clear, high voice saying something at the top of the stairs outside. A
      rhythmical SWISH of skirts, punctuated by the light PAT-PAT of a girl
      tripping downstairs, brought him to his feet. A moment later the curtains
      parted and she entered, holding out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I did keep you waiting such a long time!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood holding her hand, suddenly unable to say a word, looking at her
      hungrily. A flood of emotion, of which he had had no prevision, swelled up
      within him to fill his throat. An almost irresistible impulse all but
      controlled him to crush her to him, to kiss her lips and her throat, to
      lose his fingers in the soft, shadowy fineness of her hair. The crest of
      the wave passed almost immediately, but it left him shaken. A faint colour
      deepened under the transparence of her skin; her fathomless black eyes
      widened ever so little; she released her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was good of you to come so promptly,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I'm so anxious to
      hear all about the dear people at Redding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She settled gracefully in one of the little chairs. Orde sat down, once
      more master of himself, but still inclined to devour her with his gaze.
      She was dressed in a morning gown, all laces and ribbons and long, flowing
      lines. Her hair was done low on the back of her head and on the nape of
      her neck. The blood ebbed and flowed beneath her clear skin. A faint
      fragrance of cleanliness diffused itself about her&mdash;the cool, sweet
      fragrance of daintiness. They entered busily into conversation. Her
      attitudes were no longer relaxed and languidly graceful as in the easy
      chairs under the lamplight. She sat forward, her hands crossed on her lap,
      a fire smouldering deep beneath the cool surface lights of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounds in the next room increased in volume, as though several people
      must have entered that apartment. In a moment or so the curtains to the
      hall parted to frame the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Bishop wishes to know, miss,&rdquo; said that functionary, &ldquo;if you're not
      coming to breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you had your breakfast yet?&rdquo; he cried, conscience stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you gather the fact that I'm just up?&rdquo; she mocked him. &ldquo;I assure
      you it doesn't matter. The family has just come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried Orde, &ldquo;I wasn't here until nine o'clock. I thought, of
      course, you'd be around. I'm mighty sorry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, la la!&rdquo; she cried, cutting him short. &ldquo;What a bother about nothing.
      Don't you see&mdash;I'm ahead a whole hour of good talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, you told me in your note to come early,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot you were one of those dreadful outdoor men. You didn't see any
      worms, did you? Next time I'll tell you to come the day after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde was for taking his leave, but this she would not have.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must meet my family,&rdquo; she negatived. &ldquo;For if you're here for so short
      a time we want to see something of you. Come right out now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde thereupon followed her down a narrow, dark hall, squeezed between the
      stairs and the wall, to a door that opened slantwise into a dining-room
      the exact counterpart in shape to the parlour at the other side of the
      house. Only in this case the morning sun and more diaphanous curtains lent
      an air of brightness, further enhanced by a wire stand of flowers in the
      bow-windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The centre of the room was occupied by a round table, about which were
      grouped several people of different ages. With her back to the bow-window
      sat a woman well beyond middle age, but with evidently some pretensions to
      youth. She was tall, desiccated, quick in movement. Dark rings below her
      eyes attested either a nervous disease, an hysterical temperament, or
      both. Immediately at her left sat a boy of about fourteen years of age,
      his face a curious contradiction between a naturally frank and open
      expression and a growing sullenness. Next him stood a vacant chair,
      evidently for Miss Bishop. Opposite lolled a young man, holding a
      newspaper in one hand and a coffee cup in the other. He was very handsome,
      with a drooping black moustache, dark eyes, under lashes almost too
      luxuriant, and a long, oval face, dark in complexion, and a trifle
      sardonic in expression. In the VIS-A-VIS to Mrs. Bishop, Orde was
      surprised to find his ex-military friend of the street car. Miss Bishop
      performed the necessary introductions, which each acknowledged after his
      fashion, but with an apparent indifference that dashed Orde, accustomed to
      a more Western cordiality. Mrs. Bishop held out a languidly graceful hand,
      the boy mumbled a greeting, the young man nodded lazily over his
      newspaper. Only General Bishop, recognising him, arose and grasped his
      hand, with a real, though rather fussy, warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I am honoured to see you again. This, my dear,&rdquo;
       he addressed his wife, &ldquo;is the young man I was telling you about&mdash;in
      the street car,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very interesting,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bishop, with evidently no comprehension
      and less interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Bishop cast an ironically amused glance across at Orde. The boy
      looked up at him quickly, the sullenness for a moment gone from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll Bishop appeared quite unconscious of an atmosphere which seemed to
      Orde strained, but sank into her place at the table and unfolded her
      napkin. The silent butler drew forward a chair for Orde, and stood looking
      impassively in Mrs. Bishop's direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have some breakfast with us?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;No? A cup of
      coffee, at least?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to manipulate the coffee pot, without paying the slightest
      attention to Orde's disclaimer. The general puffed out his cheeks, and
      coughed a bit in embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good cup of coffee is never amiss to an old campaigner,&rdquo; he said to
      Orde. &ldquo;It's as good as a full meal in a pinch. I remember when I was a
      major in the Eleventh, down near the City of Mexico, in '48, the time
      Hardy's command was so nearly wiped out by that viaduct&mdash;&rdquo; He half
      turned toward Orde, his face lighting up, his fingers reaching for the
      fork with which, after the custom of old soldiers, to trace the chart of
      his reminiscences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bishop rattled her cup and saucer with an uncontrollably nervous jerk
      of her slender body. For some moments she had awaited a chance to get the
      general's attention. &ldquo;Spare us, father,&rdquo; she said brusquely. &ldquo;Will you
      have another cup of coffee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman, arrested in mid-career, swallowed, looked a trifle
      bewildered, but subsided meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, my dear,&rdquo; said he, and went furiously at his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde, overwhelmed by embarrassment, discovered that none of the others had
      paid the incident the slightest attention. Only on the lips of Gerald
      Bishop he surprised a fine, detached smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the butler entered bearing the mail. Mrs. Bishop tore hers
      open rapidly, dropping the mangled envelopes at her side. The contents of
      one seemed to vex her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried aloud. &ldquo;That miserable Marie! She promised me to have it
      done to-day, and now she puts it off until Monday. It's too provoking!&rdquo;
       She turned to Orde for sympathy. &ldquo;Do you know ANYTHING more aggravating
      than to work and slave to the limit of endurance, and then have everything
      upset by the stupidity of some one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde murmured an appropriate reply, to which Mrs. Bishop paid no attention
      whatever. She started suddenly up from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see about it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I plainly see I shall have to do it
      myself. I WILL do it myself. I promised it for Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't do another stitch, mother,&rdquo; put in Carroll Bishop decidedly.
      &ldquo;You know what the doctor told you. You'll have yourself down sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, see for yourself!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bishop. &ldquo;That's what comes of leaving
      things to others! If I'd done it myself, it would have saved me all this
      bother and fuss, and it would have been done. And now I've got to do it
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; put in the general, &ldquo;perhaps Carroll can see Marie about it. In
      any case, there's nothing to work yourself up into such an excitement
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very easy for you to talk, isn't it?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bishop, turning on
      him. &ldquo;I like the way you all sit around like lumps and do nothing, and
      then tell me how I ought to have done it. John, have the carriage around
      at once.&rdquo; She turned tensely to Orde. &ldquo;I hope you'll excuse me,&rdquo; she said
      very briefly; &ldquo;I have something very important to attend to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carroll had also risen. Orde held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be going,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she conceded, &ldquo;I suppose I'd better see if I can't help mother
      out. But you'll come in again. Come and dine with us this evening. Mother
      will be delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Bishop had departed from the room, Orde had to take for granted
      the expression of this delight. He bowed to the other occupants of the
      table. The general was eating nervously. Gerald's eyes were fixed amusedly
      on Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Orde's surprise, he was almost immediately joined on the street by
      young Mr. Bishop, most correctly appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going anywhere in particular?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Let's go up the avenue,
      then. Everybody will be out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned up the great promenade, a tour of which was then, even more
      than now, considered obligatory on the gracefully idle. Neither said
      anything&mdash;Orde because he was too absorbed in the emotions this
      sudden revelation of Carroll's environment had aroused in him; Gerald,
      apparently, because he was too indifferent. Nevertheless it was the young
      exquisite who finally broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an altar cloth,&rdquo; said he suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Orde, rather bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother is probably the most devout woman in New York,&rdquo; went on Gerald's
      even voice. &ldquo;She is one of the hardest workers in the church. She keeps
      all the fast days, and attends all the services. Although she has no
      strength to speak of, she has just completed an elaborate embroidered
      altar cloth. The work she accomplished while on her knees. Often she spent
      five or six hours a day in that position. It was very devout, but against
      the doctor's orders, and she is at present much pulled down. Finally she
      gave way to persuasion to the extent of sending the embroidery out to be
      bound and corded. As a result, the altar cloth will not be done for next
      Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He delivered this statement in a voice absolutely colourless, without the
      faintest trace discernible of either approval or disapproval, without the
      slightest irony, yet Orde felt vaguely uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been annoying to her,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;and I hope she will
      get it done in time. Perhaps Miss Bishop will be able to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;is Madison Square&mdash;or perhaps you know New
      York? My sister would, of course, be only too glad to finish the work, but
      I fear that my mother's peculiarly ardent temperament will now insist on
      her own accomplishment of the task. But perhaps you do not understand
      temperaments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little, I'm afraid,&rdquo; confessed Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on for some distance farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father was in the Mexican War?&rdquo; said Orde, to change the trend of
      his own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a most distinguished officer. I believe he received the Medal of
      Honour for a part in the affair of the Molina del Rey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What command had he in the Civil War?&rdquo; asked Orde. &ldquo;I fooled around the
      outskirts of that a little myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father resigned from the army in '54,&rdquo; replied Gerald, with his cool,
      impersonal courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was too bad; just before the chance for more service,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Army life was incompatible with my mother's temperament,&rdquo; stated Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde said nothing more. It was Gerald's turn to end the pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are from Redding, of course,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My sister is very
      enthusiastic about the place. You are in business there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde replied briefly, but, forced by the direct, cold, and polite
      cross-questioning of his companion, he gave the latter a succinct idea of
      the sort of operations in which he was interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;I suppose you're either a broker or lawyer;
      most men are down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am neither one nor the other,&rdquo; stated Gerald. &ldquo;I am possessed of a
      sufficient income from a legacy to make business unnecessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe I'd care to&mdash;be idle,&rdquo; said Orde vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is plenty to occupy one's time,&rdquo; replied Gerald. &ldquo;I have my clubs,
      my gymnasium, my horse, and my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't there anything that particularly attracts you?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man's languid eyes grew thoughtful, and he puffed more strongly
      on his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; said he slowly, at last, &ldquo;to enter the navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you?&rdquo; asked Orde bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain family reasons make it inexpedient at present,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;My
      mother is in a very nervous state; she depends on us, and any hint of our
      leaving her is sufficient to render her condition serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the two young men were well uptown. On Gerald's initiative,
      they turned down a side street, and shortly came to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my gymnasium,&rdquo; said Gerald, pointing to a building across the
      way. &ldquo;Won't you come in with me? I am due now for my practice.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde's evening was a disappointment to him. Mrs. Bishop had, by Carroll's
      report, worked feverishly at the altar cloth all the afternoon. As a
      consequence, she had gone to bed with a bad headache. This state of
      affairs seemed to throw the entire family into a state of indecision. It
      was divided in mind as to what to do, the absolute inutility of any effort
      balancing strongly against a sense of what the invalid expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if mother wouldn't like just a taste of this beef,&rdquo; speculated
      the general, moving fussily in his chair. &ldquo;I believe somebody ought to
      take some up. She MIGHT want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man departed with the plate, but returned a few moments later,
      impassive&mdash;but still with the plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she got her hot-water bag?&rdquo; asked the boy unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Master Kendrick,&rdquo; replied the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a preoccupied silence the general again broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me somebody ought to be up there with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, father, that she can't stand any one in the room,&rdquo; said Carroll
      equably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the close of the meal, however, a distant bell tinkled faintly.
      Every one jumped as though guilty. Carroll said a hasty excuse and ran
      out. After ringing the bell, the invalid had evidently anticipated its
      answer by emerging from her room to the head of the stairs, for Orde
      caught the sharp tones of complaint, and overheard something about &ldquo;take
      all night to eat a simple meal, when I'm lying here suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of an interval a maid appeared in the doorway to say that Miss
      Carroll sent word she would not be down again for a time, and did not care
      for any more dinner. This seemed to relieve the general's mind of
      responsibility. He assumed his little fussy air of cheerfulness, told
      several stories of the war, and finally, after Kendrick had left, brought
      out some whisky and water. He winked slyly at Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't do this before the youngsters, you know,&rdquo; he chirruped craftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the meal Gerald had sat back silent, a faint amusement in his
      eye. After dinner he arose, yawned, consulted his watch, and departed,
      pleading an engagement. Orde lingered some time, listening to the general,
      in the hope that Carroll would reappear. She did not, so finally he took
      his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      He trudged back to his hotel gloomily. The day had passed in a most
      unsatisfactory manner, according to his way of looking at it. Yet he had
      come more clearly to an understanding of the girl; her cheerfulness, her
      unselfishness, and, above all, the sweet, beautiful philosophy of life
      that must lie back, to render her so uncomplainingly the slave of the
      self-willed woman, yet without the indifferent cynicism of Gerald, the
      sullen, yet real, partisanship of Kendrick, or the general's week-kneed
      acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he succeeded in making an arrangement by letter for an
      excursion to the newly projected Central Park. Promptly at two o'clock he
      was at the Bishops' house. To his inquiry the butler said that Mrs. Bishop
      had recovered from her indisposition, and that Miss Bishop would be down
      immediately. Orde had not long to wait for her. The SWISH, PAT-PAT of her
      joyous descent of the stairs brought him to his feet. She swept aside the
      portieres, and stood between their folds, bidding him welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so sorry about last night,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but poor mother does depend on
      me so at such times. Isn't it a gorgeous day to walk? It won't be much
      like OUR woods, will it? But it will be something. OH, I'm so glad to get
      out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was in one of her elfish moods, the languid grace of her sleepy-eyed
      moments forgotten. With a little cry of rapture she ran to the piano, and
      dashed into a gay, tinkling air with brilliancy and abandon. Her head,
      surmounted by a perky, high-peaked, narrow-brimmed hat, with a flaming red
      bird in front, glorified by the braid and &ldquo;waterfall&rdquo; of that day, bent
      forward and turned to flash an appeal for sympathy toward Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, I feel more able to stay on earth!&rdquo; she cried, springing to her
      feet. &ldquo;Now I'll get on my gloves and we'll start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned slowly before the mirror, examining quite frankly the hang of
      her skirt, the fit of her close-cut waist, the turn of the adorable round,
      low-cut collars that were then the mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It pays to be particular; we are in New York,&rdquo; she answered, or parried,
      Orde's glance of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gloves finally drawn on and buttoned, Orde held aside the portieres,
      and she passed fairly under his uplifted hand. He wanted to drop his arm
      about her, this slender girl with her quaint dignity, her bird-like ways,
      her gentle, graceful, mysterious, feminine soul. The flame-red bird lent
      its colour to her cheeks; her eyes, black and fathomless, the pupils wide
      in this dim light, shone with two stars of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as they moved toward the massive front doors, Mrs. Bishop came down
      the stairs behind them. She, too, was dressed for the street. She received
      Orde's greeting and congratulation over her improved health in rather an
      absent manner. Indeed, as soon as she could hurry this preliminary over,
      she plunged into what evidently she considered a more important matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren't thinking of going out, are you?&rdquo; she asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, mother; don't you remember? Mr. Orde and I are going to get a
      little air in the park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bishop, with great brevity and decision, &ldquo;but I'm
      going to the rectory to help Mr. Merritt, and I shall want you to go too,
      to see about the silver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mother,&rdquo; expostulated Carroll, &ldquo;wouldn't Marie do just as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well she can't be trusted without direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I DO so want to go to the park,&rdquo; said Carroll wistfully. Mrs. Bishop's
      thin, nervous figure jerked spasmodically. &ldquo;There is very little asked of
      you from morning until night,&rdquo; she said, with some asperity, &ldquo;and I should
      think you'd have some slight consideration for the fact that I'm just up
      from a sick bed to spare me all you could. Besides which, you do very
      little for the church. I won't insist. Do exactly as you think best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carroll threw a pathetic glance at Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon are you going?&rdquo; she asked her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In about ten minutes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bishop; &ldquo;as soon as I've seen
      Honorine about the dinner.&rdquo; She seemed abruptly to realise that the
      amenities demanded something of her. &ldquo;I'm sorry we must go so soon,&rdquo; she
      said briefly to Orde, &ldquo;but of course church business&mdash;We shall hope
      to see you often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more Orde held aside the curtains. The flame-bird drooped from the
      twilight of the hall into the dimness of the parlour. All the brightness
      seemed to have drained from the day, and all the joy of life seemed to
      have faded from the girl's soul. She sank into a chair, and tried
      pathetically to smile across at Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm such a baby about disappointments,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he replied, very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it's such a blue and gold day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She twisted her glove in her lap, a bright spot of colour burning in each
      cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother is not well, and she has a great deal to try her. Poor mother!&rdquo;
       she said softly, her head cast down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Orde in his gentle tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment he arose to go. She remained seated, her head down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry about this afternoon,&rdquo; said he cheerfully, &ldquo;but it couldn't be
      helped, could it? Jane used to tell me about your harp playing. I'm going
      to come in to hear you this evening. May I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, in a stifled voice, and held out her hand. She sat quite
      still until she heard the front door close after him; then she ran to the
      curtains and looked after his sturdy, square figure, as it swung up the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done; oh, well done, gentle heart!&rdquo; she breathed after him. Then she
      went back to the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Orde's mouth, could she have seen it, was set in grim lines, and his
      feet, could she have heard them, rang on the pavement with quite
      superfluous vigour. He turned to the left, and, without pause, walked some
      ten or twelve miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening turned out very well, fortunately; Orde could not have stood
      much more. They had the parlour quite to themselves. Carroll took the
      cover from the tall harp, and, leaning her cheek against it, she played
      dreamily for a half hour. Her arms were bare, and as her fingers reached
      out lingeringly and caressingly to draw the pure, golden chords from the
      golden instrument, her soft bosom pressed against the broad sounding
      board. There is about the tones of a harp well played something luminous,
      like rich, warm sunlight. When the girl muted the strings at last, it
      seemed to Orde as though all at once the room had perceptibly darkened. He
      took his leave finally, his spirit soothed and restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tranquillity was not for long, however. Orde's visits were, naturally, as
      frequent as possible. To them almost instantly Mrs. Bishop opposed the
      strong and intuitive jealousy of egotism. She had as yet no fears as to
      the young man's intentions, but instinctively she felt an influence that
      opposed her own supreme dominance. In consequence, Orde had much time to
      himself. Carroll and the rest of the family, with the possible exception
      of Gerald, shared the belief that the slightest real opposition to Mrs.
      Bishop would suffice to throw her into one of her &ldquo;spells,&rdquo; a condition of
      alarming and possibly genuine collapse. &ldquo;To drive mother into a spell&rdquo; was
      an expression of the worst possible domestic crime. It accused the
      perpetrator&mdash;through Mrs. Bishop&mdash;of forgetting the state of
      affairs, of ingratitude for care and affection, of common inhumanity, and
      of impiety in rendering impossible of performance the multifarious church
      duties Mrs. Bishop had invented and assumed as so many particularly
      shining virtues. Orde soon discovered that Carroll went out in society
      very little for the simple reason that she could never give an unqualified
      acceptance to an invitation. At the last moment, when she had donned her
      street wraps and the carriage was at the door, she was liable to be called
      back, either to assist at some religious function, which, by its sacred
      character, was supposed to have precedence over everything, or to attend a
      nervous crisis, brought on by some member of the household, or by mere
      untoward circumstances. The girl always acquiesced most sweetly in these
      recurrent disappointments. And the very fact that she accepted few
      invitations gave Orde many more chances to see her, in spite of Mrs.
      Bishop's increasing exactions. He did not realise this fact, however, but
      ground his teeth and clung blind-eyed to his temper whenever the mother
      cut short his visits or annulled his engagements on some petty excuse of
      her own. He could almost believe these interruptions malicious, were it
      not that he soon discovered Mrs. Bishop well disposed toward him
      personally whenever he showed himself ready to meet her even quarter way
      on the topics that interested her&mdash;the church and her health.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner the week passed. Orde saw as much as he could of Miss
      Bishop. The remainder of the time he spent walking the streets and reading
      in the club rooms to which Gerald's courtesy had given him access. Gerald
      himself seemed to be much occupied. Precisely at eleven every morning,
      however, he appeared at the gymnasium for his practice; and in this Orde
      dropped into the habit of joining him. When the young men first stripped
      in each other's presence, they eyed each other with a secret surprise.
      Gerald's slender and elegant body turned out to be smoothly and gracefully
      muscled on the long lines of the Flying Mercury. His bones were small, but
      his flesh was hard, and his skin healthy with the flow of blood beneath.
      Orde, on the other hand, had earned from the river the torso of an ancient
      athlete. The round, full arch of his chest was topped by a mass of
      clean-cut muscle; across his back, beneath the smooth skin, the muscles
      rippled and ridged and dimpled with every movement; the beautiful curve of
      the deltoids, from the point of the shoulder to the arm, met the other
      beautiful curve of the unflexed biceps and that fulness of the back arm so
      often lacking in a one-sided development; the surface of the abdomen
      showed the peculiar corrugation of the very strong man; the round,
      columnar neck arose massive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Gerald, roused at last from his habitual apathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; asked Orde, looking up from tying the rubber-soled
      shoes that Gerald had lent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murphy,&rdquo; called Gerald, &ldquo;come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very hairy, thick-set, bullet-headed man, the type of semi-professional
      &ldquo;handlers,&rdquo; emerged from somewhere across the gymnasium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you could down this fellow?&rdquo; asked Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murphy looked Orde over critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who ye ringin' in on me?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a friend of mine,&rdquo; said Gerald severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg your pardon. The gentleman is well put up. How much experience has he
      had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever box much?&rdquo; Gerald asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Box?&rdquo; Orde laughed. &ldquo;Never had time for that sort of thing. Had the
      gloves on a few times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get your training, sir?&rdquo; asked the handler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My training?&rdquo; repeated Orde, puzzled. &ldquo;Oh, I see! I was always pretty
      heavy, and I suppose the work on the river keeps a man in pretty good
      shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald's languor had vanished, and a glint had appeared in his eye that
      would have reminded Orde of Miss Bishop's most mischievous mood could he
      have seen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on the gloves with Murphy,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;will you? I'd like to see
      you two at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; agreed Orde good-naturedly. &ldquo;I'm not much good at it, but I'd
      just as soon try.&rdquo; He was evidently not in the least afraid to meet the
      handler, though as evidently without much confidence in his own skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I'll be with you in a second,&rdquo; said Gerald, disappearing. In
      the anteroom he rung a bell, and to the boy who leisurely answered its
      summons he said rapidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run over to the club and find Mr. Winslow, Mr. Clark, and whoever else is
      in the smoking room, and tell them from me to come over to the gymnasium.
      Tell them there's some fun on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he returned to the gymnasium floor, where Murphy was answering Orde's
      questions as to the apparatus. While the two men were pulling on the
      gloves, Gerald managed a word apart with the trainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you do him, Murph?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said the handler. &ldquo;Them kind's always as slow as dray-horses. They
      gets muscle-bound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to him,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;but don't kill him. He's a friend of
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he stepped back, the same joy in his soul that inspires a riverman
      when he encounters a high-banker; a hunter when he takes out a greenhorn,
      or a cowboy as he watches the tenderfoot about to climb the bronco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first round was sharp. When Gerald called the end, Orde grinned at him
      cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look like I was much at this game, does it?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I wouldn't
      pull down many persimmons out of that tree. Your confounded man's too
      lively; I couldn't hit him with a shotgun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde had stood like a rock, his feet planted to the floor, while Murphy
      had circled around him hitting at will. Orde hit back, but without
      landing. Nevertheless Murphy, when questioned apart, did not seem
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man's pig-iron,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I punched him plenty hard enough, and it
      didn't seem to jar him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gallery at one end the running track had by now half filled with
      interested spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time!&rdquo; called Gerald for round two.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Murphy went in more viciously, aiming and measuring his blows
      accurately. Orde stood as before, a humourous smile of self-depreciation
      on his face, hitting back at the elusive Murphy, but without much effect,
      his feet never stirring in their tracks. The handler used his best tactics
      and landed almost at will, but without apparent damage. He grew ugly&mdash;finally
      lost his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if ye will have it!&rdquo; he muttered, and aimed what was intended as a
      knockout blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald uttered a half cry of warning as his practised eye caught Murphy's
      intention. The blow landed. Orde's head snapped back, but to the surprise
      of every one the punch had no other effect, and a quick exchange of
      infighting sent Murphy staggering back from the encounter. The smile had
      disappeared from Orde's face, and his eye had calmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he called to Gerald, &ldquo;I don't understand this game very well.
      At school we used 'taps.' Is a man supposed to hit hard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald hesitated, then looked beyond Orde to the gallery. To a man it made
      frantic and silent demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you hit,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You can't hurt any one with those big
      gloves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde turned back to his antagonist. The latter advanced once more, his
      bullet head sunk between his shoulders, his little eyes twinkling.
      Evidently Mr. Bishop's friend would now take the aggressive, and forward
      movement would deliver an extra force to the professional's blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde did not wait for Murphy, however. Like a tiger he sprang forward,
      hitting out fiercely, first with one hand then with the other. Murphy gave
      ground, blocked, ducked, exerted all a ring general's skill either to stop
      or avoid the rush. Orde followed him insistent. Several times he landed,
      but always when Murphy was on the retreat, so the blows had not much
      weight. Several times Murphy ducked in and planted a number of short-arm
      jabs at close range. The round ended almost immediately to a storm of
      applause from the galleries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of his being muscle-bound?&rdquo; Gerald asked Murphy, as the
      latter flung himself panting on the wrestling mat for his rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's quick as chained lightning,&rdquo; acknowledged the other grudgingly. &ldquo;But
      I'll get him. He can't keep that up; he'll be winded in half a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde sat down on a roll of mat. His smile had quite vanished, and he
      seemed to be awaiting eagerly the beginning of the next round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time!&rdquo; called Gerald for the third.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde immediately sprang at his adversary, repeating the headlong rush with
      which the previous round had ended. Murphy blocked, ducked, and kept away,
      occasionally delivering a jolt as opportunity offered, awaiting the time
      when Orde's weariness would leave him at the other's mercy. That moment
      did not come. The young man hammered away tirelessly, insistently,
      delivering a hurricane of his two-handed blows, pressing relentlessly in
      as Murphy shifted and gave ground, his head up, his eyes steady, oblivious
      to the return hammering the now desperate handler opposed to him. Two
      minutes passed without perceptible slackening in this terrific pace. The
      gallery was in an uproar, and some of the members were piling down the
      stairs to the floor. Perspiration stood out all over Murphy's body. His
      blows failed of their effect, and some of Orde's were landing. At length,
      bewildered more by the continuance than the violence of the attack, he
      dropped his ring tactics and closed in to straight slugging, blow against
      blow, stand up, give and take.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he saw his opponent stand, Orde uttered a sound of satisfaction. He
      dropped slightly his right shoulder behind his next blow. The glove
      crashed straight as a pile-driver through Murphy's upraised hands to his
      face, which it met with a smack. The trainer, lifted bodily from the
      ground, was hurled through the air, to land doubled up against the
      supports of a parallel bars. There he lay quite still, his palms up, his
      head sunk forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde stared at him a moment in astonishment, as though expecting him to
      arise. When, however, he perceived that Murphy was in reality unconscious,
      he tore off the gloves and ran forward to kneel by the professional's
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't suppose one punch like that would hurt him,&rdquo; he muttered to the
      men crowding around. &ldquo;Especially with the gloves. Do you suppose he's
      killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But already Murphy's arms were making aimless motions, and a deep breath
      raised his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's just knocked out,&rdquo; reassured one of the men, examining the prostrate
      handler with a professional attention. &ldquo;He'll be as good as ever in five
      minutes. Here,&rdquo; he commanded one of the gymnasium rubbers who had
      appeared, &ldquo;lend a hand here with some water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clubmen crowded about, all talking at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a wonder, my friend,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, he's hardly breathing fast after all that rushing,&rdquo; said a
      second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you didn't think one punch like that would hurt him,&rdquo; quoted another
      with good-natured sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Orde, simply. &ldquo;I've hit men that hard before with my bare
      fist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they survive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of armour-plates were they, in heaven's name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde had recovered his balance and humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just plain ordinary rivermen,&rdquo; said he with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; struck in Gerald, &ldquo;I want to introduce you to my friend.&rdquo; He
      performed the introductions. It was necessary for him to explain apart
      that Orde was in reality his friend, an amateur, a chance visitor in the
      city. All in all, the affair made quite a little stir, and went far to
      give Orde a standing with these sport-loving youths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Gerald and Orde were permitted to finish their gymnasium practice.
      Murphy had recovered, and came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a strong punch, sir, and you're a born natural fighter, sir,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;If you had a few lessons in boxing, sir, I'd put you against the
      best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But later, when the young men were resting, each under his sheet after a
      rub-down, the true significance of the affair for Orde came out. Since the
      fight, Gerald's customary lassitude of manner seemed quite to have left
      him. His eye was bright, a colour mounted beneath the pale olive of his
      skin, the almost effeminate beauty of his countenance had animated. He
      looked across at Orde several times, hesitated, and at last decided to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Orde,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I want to confess something to you. When you
      first came here three days ago, I had lots of fun with myself about you.
      You know your clothes aren't quite the thing, and I thought your manner
      was queer, and all that. I was a cad. I want to apologise. You're a man,
      and I like you better than any fellow I've met for a long time. And if
      there's any trouble&mdash;in the future&mdash;that is&mdash;oh, hang it,
      I'm on your side&mdash;you know what I mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde smiled slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bishop,&rdquo; was his unexpected reply, &ldquo;you're not near so much of a dandy as
      you think you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Affairs went thus for a week. Orde was much at the Bishop residence, where
      he was cordially received by the general, where he gained an occasional
      half-hour with Carroll, and where he was almost ignored by Mrs. Bishop in
      her complete self-absorption. Indeed, it is to be doubted whether he
      attained any real individuality to that lady, who looked on all the world
      outside her family as useful or useless to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the happy moments he had alone with Carroll, he arrived
      at a more intimate plane of conversation with her. He came to an
      understanding of her unquestioning acceptance of Mrs. Bishop's attitude.
      Carroll truly believed that none but herself could perform for her mother
      the various petty offices that lady demanded from her next of kin, and
      that her practical slavery was due by every consideration of filial
      affection. To Orde's occasional tentative suggestion that the service was
      of a sort better suited to a paid companion or even a housemaid, she
      answered quite seriously that it made mother nervous to have others about
      her, and that it was better to do these things than to throw her into a
      &ldquo;spell.&rdquo; Orde chafed at first over seeing his precious opportunities thus
      filched from him; later he fretted because he perceived that Carroll was
      forced, however willingly, to labours beyond her strength, to irksome
      confinement, and to that intimate and wearing close association with the
      abnormal which in the long run is bound to deaden the spirit. He lost
      sight of his own grievance in the matter. With perhaps somewhat of
      exaggeration he came mightily to desire for her more of the open air, both
      of body and spirit. Often when tramping back to his hotel he communed
      savagely with himself, turning the problem over and over in his mind
      until, like a snowball, it had gathered to itself colossal proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in his hotel room he brooded over the state of affairs until his
      thoughts took a very gloomy tinge indeed. To begin with, in spite of his
      mother's assurance, he had no faith in his own cause. His acquaintance
      with Carroll was but an affair of months, and their actual meetings
      comprised incredibly few days. Orde was naturally humble-minded. It did
      not seem conceivable to him that he could win her without a long
      courtship. And superadded was the almost intolerable weight of Carroll's
      ideas as to her domestic duties. Although Orde held Mrs. Bishop's
      exactions in very slight esteem, and was most sceptical in regard to the
      disasters that would follow their thwarting, nevertheless he had to
      confess to himself that all Carroll's training, life, the very purity and
      sweetness of her disposition lent the situation an iron reality for her.
      He became much discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, at the very moment when he had made up his mind that it
      would be utterly useless even to indulge in hope for some years to come,
      he spoke. It came about suddenly, and entirely without premeditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two had escaped for a breath of air late in the evening. Following the
      conventions, they merely strolled to the end of the block and back, always
      within sight of the house. Fifth Avenue was gay with illumination and the
      prancing of horses returning uptown or down to the Washington Square
      district. In contrast the side street, with its austere rows of brownstone
      houses, each with its area and flight of steps, its spaced gas lamps, its
      deserted roadway, seemed very still and quiet. Carroll was in a tired and
      pensive mood. She held her head back, breathing deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only a little strip, but it's the stars,&rdquo; said she, looking up to
      the sky between the houses. &ldquo;They're so quiet and calm and big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to Orde for the first time like a little girl. The maturer
      complexities which we put on with years, with experience, and with the
      knowledge of life had for the moment fallen from her, leaving merely the
      simple soul of childhood gazing in its eternal wonder at the stars. A wave
      of tenderness lifted Orde from his feet. He leaned over, his breath coming
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carroll!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him, and shrank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! You mustn't,&rdquo; she cried. She did not pretend to misunderstand.
      The preliminaries seemed in some mysterious fashion to have been said long
      ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's life or death with me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not,&rdquo; she cried, fluttering like a bird. &ldquo;I promised myself long
      ago that I must always, ALWAYS take care of mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, please, dear,&rdquo; pleaded Orde. He had nothing more to say than
      this, just the simple incoherent symbols of pleading; but in such crises
      it is rather the soul than the tongue that speaks. His hand met hers and
      closed about it. It did not respond to his grasp, nor did it draw away,
      but lay limp and warm and helpless in his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you care for me, dear?&rdquo; asked Orde very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to tell you that,&rdquo; answered she. &ldquo;I have tried, oh, so
      hard, to keep you from saying this, for I knew I had no right to hear
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde's heart leaped with a wild exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do care for me!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had mounted the steps and stood just within the vestibule. Orde drew
      her toward him, but she repulsed him gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she shook her head. &ldquo;Please be very good to me. I'm very weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carroll!&rdquo; cried Orde. &ldquo;Tell me that you love me! Tell me that you'll
      marry me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would kill mother if I should leave her,&rdquo; she said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must marry me,&rdquo; pleaded Orde. &ldquo;We are made for each other. God
      meant us for each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have to be after a great many years,&rdquo; she said doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pulled the bell, which jangled faintly in the depths of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come to me to-morrow. No, you must not come in.&rdquo;
       She cut short Orde's insistence and the eloquence that had just found its
      life by slipping inside the half-open door and closing it after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde stood for a moment uncertain; then turned away and walked up the
      street, his eyes so blinded by the greater glory that he all but ran down
      an inoffensive passer-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hotel he wrote a long letter to his mother. The first part was full
      of the exultation of his discovery. He told of his good fortune quite as
      something just born, utterly forgetting his mother's predictions before he
      came East. Then as the first effervescence died, a more gloomy view of the
      situation came uppermost. To his heated imagination the deadlock seemed
      complete. Carroll's devotion to what she considered her duty appeared
      unbreakable. In the reaction Orde doubted whether he would have it
      otherwise. And then his fighting blood surged back to his heart. All the
      eloquence, the arguments, the pleadings he should have commanded earlier
      in the evening hurried belated to their posts. After the manner of the
      young and imaginative when in the white fire of emotion, he began
      dramatising scenes between Carroll and himself. He saw them plainly. He
      heard the sound of his own voice as he rehearsed the arguments which
      should break her resolution. A woman's duty to her own soul; her
      obligation toward the man she could make or mar by her love; her
      self-respect; the necessity of a break some time; the advantage of having
      the crisis over with now rather than later; a belief in the ultimate good
      even to Mrs. Bishop of throwing that lady more on her own resources; and
      so forth and so on down a list of arguments obvious enough or trivial
      enough, but all inspired by the soul of fervour, all ennobled by the
      spirit of truth that lies back of the major premise that a woman should
      cleave to a man, forsaking all others. Orde sat back in his chair, his
      eyes vacant, his pen all but falling from his hand. He did not finish the
      letter to his mother. After a while he went upstairs to his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fever of the argument coursed through his veins all that long night.
      Over and over again he rehearsed it in wearisome repetition until it had
      assumed a certain and almost invariable form. And when he had reached the
      end of his pleading he began it over again, until the daylight found him
      weary and fevered. He arose and dressed himself. He could eat no
      breakfast. By a tremendous effort of the will he restrained himself from
      going over to Ninth Street until the middle of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the drawing-room to find her seated at the piano. His heart
      bounded, and for an instant he stood still, summoning his forces to the
      struggle for which he had so painfully gathered his ammunition. She did
      not look up as he approached until he stood almost at her shoulder. Then
      she turned to him and held out both her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no use, Jack,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I care for you too much. I will marry you
      whenever you say.&rdquo;

      XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde left that evening early. This was at Carroll's request. She preferred
      herself to inform her family of the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know yet how mother is going to get along,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Come back
      to-morrow afternoon and see them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Orde, having at last finished and despatched the letter
      to his mother, drifted up the avenue and into the club. As he passed the
      smoking room he caught sight of Gerald seated in an armchair by the
      window. He entered the room and took a seat opposite the young fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald held out his hand silently, which the other took.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Gerald at last. &ldquo;Very glad. I told you I was
      on your side.&rdquo; He hesitated, then went on gravely: &ldquo;Poor Carroll is having
      a hard time, though. I think it's worse than she expected. It's no worse
      than I expected. You are to be one of the family, so I am going to give
      you a piece of advice. It's something, naturally, I wouldn't speak of
      otherwise. But Carroll is my only sister, and I want her to be happy. I
      think you are the man to make her so, but I want you to avoid one mistake.
      Fight it out right now, and never give back the ground you win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that,&rdquo; replied Orde quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother made father resign from the army; and while he's a dear old boy,
      he's never done anything since. She holds me&mdash;although I see through
      her&mdash;possibly because I'm weak or indifferent, possibly because I
      have a silly idea I can make a bad situation better by hanging around. She
      is rapidly turning Kendrick into a sullen little prig, because he believes
      implicitly all the grievances against the world and the individual she
      pours out to him. You see, I have no illusions concerning my family. Only
      Carroll has held to her freedom of soul, because that's the joyous, free,
      sweet nature of her, bless her! For the first time she's pitted her will
      against mother's, and it's a bad clash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother objected?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald laughed a little bitterly. &ldquo;It was very bad,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You've
      grown horns, hoofs, and a tail overnight. There's nothing too criminal to
      have escaped your notice. I have been forbidden to consort with you. So
      has the general. The battle of last night had to do with your coming to
      the house at all. As it is not Carroll's house, naturally she has no right
      to insist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be permitted to see her?&rdquo; cried Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that. Carroll announced then quite openly that she would
      see you outside. I fancy that was the crux of the matter. Don't you see?
      The whole affair shifted ground. Carroll has offered direct disobedience.
      Oh, she's a bully little fighter!&rdquo; he finished in admiring accents. &ldquo;You
      can't quite realise what she's doing for your sake; she's not only
      fighting mother, but her own heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde found a note at the hotel, asking him to be in Washington Square at
      half-past two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll met him with a bright smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things aren't quite right at home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is a great shock to
      poor mother at first, and she feels very strongly. Oh, it isn't you, dear;
      it's the notion that I can care for anybody but her. You see, she's been
      used to the other idea so long that I suppose it seemed a part of the
      universe to her. She'll get used to it after a little, but it takes time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde examined her face anxiously. Two bright red spots burned on her
      cheeks; her eyes flashed with a nervous animation, and a faint shade had
      sketched itself beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a hard time,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;you poor dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have to pay for the good things in life, don't we, dear? And they are
      worth it. Things will come right after a little. We must not be too
      impatient. Now, let's enjoy the day. The park isn't so bad, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At five o'clock Orde took her back to her doorstep, where he left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This went on for several days.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of that time Orde could not conceal from himself that the
      strain was beginning to tell. Carroll's worried expression grew from day
      to day, while the animation that characterised her manner when freed from
      the restraint became more and more forced. She was as though dominated by
      some inner tensity, which she dared not relax even for a moment. To Orde's
      questionings she replied as evasively as she could, assuring him always
      that matters were going as well as she had expected; that mother was very
      difficult; that Orde must have patience, for things would surely come all
      right. She begged him to remain quiescent until she gave him the word; and
      she implored it so earnestly that Orde, though he chafed, was forced to
      await the turn of events. Every afternoon she met him, from two to five.
      The situation gave little opportunity for lovers' demonstrations. She
      seemed entirely absorbed by the inner stress of the struggle she was going
      through, so that hardly did she seem able to follow coherently even plans
      for the future. She appeared, however, to gain a mysterious refreshment
      from Orde's mere proximity; so gradually he, with that streak of almost
      feminine intuition which is the especial gift to lovers, came to the point
      of sitting quite silent with her, clasping her hand out of sight of the
      chance passer-by. When the time came to return, they arose and walked back
      to Ninth Street, still in silence. At the door they said good-bye. He
      kissed her quite soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could help, sweetheart,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do help,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Gerald at the club, Orde sought more intimate news of what was going
      on. For several days, however, the young man absented himself from his
      usual haunts. It was only at the end of the week that Orde succeeded in
      finding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Gerald answered his greeting, &ldquo;I haven't been around much. I've been
      sticking pretty close home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, Orde's eager questions drew out the truth of the
      situation. Mrs. Bishop had shut herself up in a blind and incredible
      obstinacy, whence she sallied with floods of complaints, tears,
      accusations, despairs, reproaches, vows, hysterics&mdash;all the battery
      of the woman misunderstood, but in which she refused to listen to a
      consecutive conversation. If Carroll undertook to say anything, the third
      word would start her mother off into one of her long and hysterical
      tirades. It was very wearing, and there seemed to be nothing gained from
      day to day. Her child had disobeyed her. And as a climax, she had assumed
      the impregnable position of a complete prostration, wherein she demanded
      the minute care of an invalid in the crisis of a disorder. She could bear
      no faintest ray of illumination, no lightest footfall. In a hushed
      twilight she lay, her eyes swathed, moaning feebly that her early
      dissolution at the hands of ingratitude was imminent. Thus she established
      a deadlock which was likely to continue indefinitely. The mere mention of
      the subject nearest Carroll's heart brought the feeble complaint:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to kill me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The only scrap of victory to be snatched from this stricken field was the
      fact that Carroll insisted on going to meet her lover every afternoon. The
      invalid demanded every moment of her time, either for personal attendance
      or in fulfilment of numerous and exacting church duties. An attempt,
      however, to encroach thus on the afternoon hours met a stone wall of
      resolution on Carroll's part.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the situation Orde gathered from his talk with Gerald. Though he
      fretted under the tyranny exacted, he could see nothing which could
      relieve the situation save his own withdrawal. He had already long
      over-stayed his visit; important affairs connected with his work demanded
      his attention, he had the comfort of Carroll's love assured; and the lapse
      of time alone could be depended on to change Mrs. Bishop's attitude, a
      consummation on which Carroll seemed set. Although Orde felt all the
      lively dissatisfaction natural to a newly accepted lover who had gained
      slight opportunity for favours, for confidences, even for the making of
      plans, nevertheless he could see for the present nothing else to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning after he had reached this conclusion he again met Gerald at
      the gymnasium. That young man, while as imperturbable and languid in
      movement as ever, concealed an excitement. He explained nothing until the
      two, after a shower and rub-down, were clothing themselves leisurely in
      the empty couch-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orde,&rdquo; said Gerald suddenly, &ldquo;I'm worried about Carroll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde straightened his back and looked steadily at Gerald, but said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother has commenced bothering her again. It wasn't so bad as long as she
      stuck to daytime, but now she's taken to prowling in a dozen times a
      night. I hear their voices for an hour or so at a time. I'm afraid it's
      beginning to wear on Carroll more than you realise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Orde briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon with Carroll he took the affair firmly in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This thing has come to the point where it must stop,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I'm
      going to stop it. I have some rights in the matter of the health and
      comfort of the girl I love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you intend to do?&rdquo; asked Carroll, frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have it out with your mother,&rdquo; replied Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't do that,&rdquo; implored Carroll. &ldquo;It would do absolutely no good,
      and would just result in a quarrel that could never be patched up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know as I care particularly,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do. Think&mdash;she is my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde stirred uneasily with a mental reservation as to selfishness, but
      said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And think what it means to a girl to be married and go away from home
      finally without her parent's consent. It's the most beautiful and sacred
      thing in her life, and she wants it to be perfect. It's worth waiting and
      fighting a little for. After all, we are both young, and we have known
      each other such a very short time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she pleaded with him, bringing forward all the unanswerable arguments
      built by the long average experience of the world&mdash;arguments which
      Orde could not refute, but whose falsity to the situation he felt most
      keenly. He could not specify without betraying Gerald's confidence. Raging
      inwardly, he consented to a further armistice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his hotel he found a telegram. He did not open it until he had reached
      his own room. It was from home, urging his immediate return for the
      acceptance of some contracted work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hell with the contracted work!&rdquo; he muttered savagely, and calling a
      bell-boy, sent an answer very much to that effect. Then he plunged his
      hands into his pockets, stretched out his legs, and fell into a deep and
      gloomy meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a knock on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; he called, without turning his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the door open and shut. After a moment he looked around. Kendrick
      Bishop stood watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde lit the gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Kendrick!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo; The boy made no reply. Orde looked
      at him curiously, and saw that he was suffering from an intense
      excitement. His frame trembled convulsively, his lips were white, his face
      went red and pale by turns. Evidently he had something to say, but could
      not yet trust his voice. Orde sat down and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to let my mother alone,&rdquo; he managed to say finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done nothing to your mother, Kendrick,&rdquo; said Orde kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've brought her to the point of death,&rdquo; asserted Keudrick violently.
      &ldquo;You're hounding her to her grave. You're turning those she loves best
      against her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde thought to catch the echo of quotation in these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your mother send you to me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we had any one else worth the name of man in the family, I wouldn't
      have to come,&rdquo; said Kendrick, almost in the manner of one repeating a
      lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; asked Orde after a moment of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; cried Kendrick. &ldquo;Stop this unmanly contest against a
      defenceless woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot do that,&rdquo; replied Orde quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kendrick's face assumed a livid pallor, and his eyes seemed to turn black
      with excitement. Trembling in every limb, but without hesitation, he
      advanced on Orde, drew a short riding-whip from beneath his coat, and
      slashed the young man across the face. Orde made an involuntary movement
      to arise, but sank back, and looked steadily at the boy. Once again
      Kendrick hit; raised his arm for the third time; hesitated. His lips
      writhed, and then, with a sob, he cast the little whip from him and burst
      from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde sat without moving, while two red lines slowly defined themselves
      across his face. The theatrical quality of the scene and the turgid
      rhetorical bathos of the boy's speeches attested his youth and the
      unformed violence of his emotions. Did they also indicate a rehearsal, or
      had the boy merely been goaded to vague action by implicit belief in a
      woman's vagaries? Orde did not know, but the incident brought home to him,
      as nothing else could, the turmoil of that household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor youngster!&rdquo; he concluded his reverie, and went to wash his face in
      hot water.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had left Carroll that afternoon in a comparatively philosophical and
      hopeful frame of mind. The next day she came to him with hurried, nervous
      steps, her usually pale cheeks mounting danger signals of flaming red, her
      eyes swimming. When she greeted him she choked, and two of the tears
      overflowed. Quite unmindful of the nursemaids across the square, Orde put
      his arm comfortingly about her shoulder. She hid her face against his
      sleeve and began softly to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde did not attempt as yet to draw from her the cause of this unusual
      agitation. A park bench stood between two dense bushes, screened from all
      directions save one. To this he led her. He comforted her as one comforts
      a child, stroking clumsily her hair, murmuring trivialities without
      meaning, letting her emotion relieve itself. After awhile she recovered
      somewhat her control of herself and sat up away from him, dabbing at her
      eyes with a handkerchief dampened into a tiny wad. But even after she had
      shaken her head vigorously at last, and smiled up at him rather
      tremulously in token that the storm was over, she would not tell him that
      anything definite had happened to bring on the outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just needed you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that's all. It's just nothing but being a
      woman, I think. You'll get used to little things like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This thing has got to quit!&rdquo; said he grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, but reached up shyly and touched his face where
      Kendrick's whip had stung, and her eyes became very tender. A carriage
      rolled around Washington Arch, and, coming to a stand, discharged its
      single passenger on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's Gerald!&rdquo; cried Carroll, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, catching sight of them, picked his way daintily and
      leisurely toward them. He was, as usual, dressed with meticulous nicety,
      the carnation in his button-hole, the gloss on his hat and shoes, the
      freshness on his gloves, the correct angle on his stick. His dark, long
      face with its romantic moustache, and its almost effeminate soft eyes, was
      as unemotional and wearied as ever. As he approached, he raised his stick
      slightly by way of salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a carriage, and I wish you would both do me
      the favour to accompany me on a short excursion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking their consent for granted, he signalled the vehicle, which rapidly
      approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three&mdash;Carroll and Orde somewhat bewildered&mdash;took their
      seats. During a brief drive, Gerald made conversation on different topics,
      apparently quite indifferent as to whether or not his companions replied.
      After an interval the carriage drew up opposite a brown-stone dwelling on
      a side street. Gerald rang the bell, and a moment later the three were
      ushered by a discreet and elderly maid into a little square reception-room
      immediately off the hall. The maid withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald carefully deposited his top hat on the floor, placed in it his
      gloves, and leaned his stick against its brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought you here, among other purposes, to hear from me a little
      brief wisdom drawn from experience and the observation of life,&rdquo; he began,
      addressing his expectant and curious guests. &ldquo;That wisdom is briefly this:
      there comes a time in the affairs of every household when a man must
      assert himself as the ruler. In all the details he may depend on the
      woman's judgment, experience, and knowledge, but when it comes to the big
      crises, where life is deflected into one channel or the other, then,
      unless the man does the deciding, he is lost for ever, and his happiness,
      and the happiness of those who depend on him. This is abstruse, but I come
      to the particular application shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But moments of decision are always clouded by many considerations. The
      decision is sure to cut across much that is expedient, much that seems to
      be necessary, much that is dear. Carroll remembers the case of our own
      father. The general would have made a name for himself in the army; his
      wife demanded his retirement; he retired, and his career ended. That was
      the moment of his decision. It is very easy to say, in view of that simple
      statement, that the general was weak in yielding to his wife, but a
      consideration of the circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say all this?&rdquo; interrupted Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald raised his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, it is necessary, as you will agree when you have heard me
      through. Mrs. Bishop was in poor health; the general in poor financial
      circumstances. The doctors said the Riviera. Mrs. Bishop's parents, who
      were wealthy, furnished the money for her sojourn in that climate. She
      could not bear to be separated from her husband. A refusal to resign then,
      a refusal to accept the financial aid offered, would have been cast
      against him as a reproach&mdash;he did not love his wife enough to
      sacrifice his pride, his ambition, his what-you-will. Nevertheless, that
      was his moment of decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could multiply instances, yet it would only accumulate needless proof.
      My point is that in these great moments a man can afford to take into
      consideration only the affair itself. Never must he think of anything but
      the simple elements of the problem&mdash;he must ignore whose toes are
      trodden upon, whose feelings are hurt, whose happiness is apparently
      marred. For note this: if a man does fearlessly the right thing, I am
      convinced that in the readjustment all these conflicting interests find
      themselves bettered instead of injured. You want a concrete instance? I
      believe firmly that if the general had kept to his army life, and made his
      wife conform to it, after the storm had passed she would have settled down
      to a happy existence. I cannot prove it&mdash;I believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may be all very true, Gerald,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;but I fail to see why you
      have brought us to this strange house to tell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo; replied Gerald. &ldquo;Have patience. Believing that thoroughly,
      I have come in the last twenty-four hours to a decision. That this happens
      not to affect my own immediate fortunes does not seem to me to invalidate
      my philosophy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He carefully unbuttoned his frock coat, crossed his legs, produced a paper
      and a package from his inside pocket, and eyed the two before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have here,&rdquo; he went on suddenly, &ldquo;marriage papers duly made out; in
      this package is a plain gold ring; in the next room is waiting, by
      prearrangement, a very good friend of mine in the clergy. Personally I am
      at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at them expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried Orde and Carroll in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, in spite of this divergence of opinion, ten minutes later
      the three passed through the door into the back apartment&mdash;Carroll
      still hesitant, Orde in triumph, Gerald as correct and unemotional as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this back room they found waiting a young clergyman conversing easily
      with two young girls. At the sight of Carroll, these latter rushed forward
      and overwhelmed her with endearments. Carroll broke into a quickly
      suppressed sob and clasped them close to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you dears!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I'm so glad you're here!&rdquo; She flashed a
      grateful look in Gerald's direction, and a moment later took occasion to
      press his arm and whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've thought of everything! You're the dearest brother in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald received this calmly, and set about organising the ceremony. In
      fifteen minutes the little party separated at the front door, amid a
      chatter of congratulations and good wishes. Mr. and Mrs. Orde entered the
      cab and drove away.

    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it IS the best way, dear, after all!&rdquo; cried Carroll, pressing close
      to her husband. &ldquo;A few minutes ago I was all doubts and fears, but now I
      feel so safe and settled,&rdquo; she laughed happily. &ldquo;It is as though I had
      belonged to you always, you old Rock of Gibraltar! and anything that
      happens now will come from the outside, and not from the inside, won't it,
      dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sweetheart,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor mother! I wonder how she'll take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll soon know, anyway,&rdquo; replied Orde, a little grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hallway of the Bishop house Orde kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be brave, sweetheart,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but remember that now you're my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded at him gravely and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde sat in the dim parlour for what seemed to be an interminable period.
      Occasionally the sounds of distant voices rose to his ear and died away
      again. The front door opened to admit some one, but Orde could not see who
      it was. Twice a scurrying of feet overhead seemed to indicate the bustle
      of excitement. The afternoon waned. A faint whiff of cooking, escaping
      through some carelessly open door, was borne to his nostrils. It grew
      dark, but the lamps remained unlighted. Finally he heard the rustle of the
      portieres, and turned to see the dim form of the general standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad business! bad business!&rdquo; muttered the old man. &ldquo;It's very hard on me.
      Perhaps you did the right thing&mdash;you must be good to her&mdash;but I
      cannot countenance this affair. It was most high-handed, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The portieres fell again, and he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, after another interval, Carroll returned. She went immediately to
      the gas-fixture, which she lit. Orde then saw that she was sobbing
      violently. She came to him, and for a moment hid her face against his
      breast. He patted her hair, waiting for her to speak. After a little she
      controlled herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it?&rdquo; asked Orde, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew people could be so cruel,&rdquo; she complained in almost a
      bewildered manner. &ldquo;Jack, we must go to-night. She&mdash;she has ordered
      me out of the house, and says she never wants to see my face again.&rdquo; She
      broke down for a second. &ldquo;Oh, Jack! she can't mean that. I've always been
      a good daughter to her. And she's very bitter against Gerald. Oh! I told
      her it wasn't his fault, but she won't listen. She sent for that odious
      Mr. Merritt&mdash;her rector, you know&mdash;and he supported her. I
      believe he's angry because we did not go to him. Could you believe such a
      thing! And she's shut herself up in her air of high virtue, and underneath
      it she's, oh, so angry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's natural she should be upset,&rdquo; comforted Orde. &ldquo;Don't think too
      much of what she does now. Later she'll get over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carroll shivered again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know, dear, and I'm not going to tell you. Why,&rdquo; she cried,
      &ldquo;she told me that you and I were in a conspiracy to drive her to her grave
      so we could get her money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be a little crazy,&rdquo; said Orde, still pacifically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, help me,&rdquo; said Carroll. &ldquo;I must get my things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you just pack a bag and leave the rest until tomorrow? It's about
      hungry time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says I must take every stitch belonging to me tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They packed trunks until late that night, quite alone. Gerald had departed
      promptly after breaking the news, probably without realising to what a
      pass affairs would come. A frightened servant, evidently in disobedience
      of orders and in fear of destruction, brought them a tray of food, which
      she put down on a small table and hastily fled. In a room down the hall
      they could hear the murmur of voices where Mrs. Bishop received spiritual
      consolation from her adviser. When the trunks were packed, Orde sent for a
      baggage waggon. Carroll went silently from place to place, saying farewell
      to such of her treasures as she had made up her mind to leave. Orde
      scribbled a note to Gerald, requesting him to pack up the miscellanies and
      send them to Michigan by freight. The baggage man and Orde carried the
      trunks downstairs. No one appeared. Carroll and Orde walked together to
      the hotel. Next morning an interview with Gerald confirmed them in their
      resolution of immediate departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is set in her opposition now, and at present she believes firmly that
      her influence will separate you. Such a state of mind cannot be changed in
      an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I,&rdquo; he shrugged, &ldquo;will go on as usual. I have my interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would come out in our part of the country,&rdquo; ventured Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald smiled his fine smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Going to a train is useless, and a bore to
      everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carroll threw herself on his neck in an access of passionate weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You WILL write and tell me of everything, won't you?&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. There now, good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde followed him into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be quite useless to attempt another interview?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald made a little mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in the same predicament as yourselves,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and have since
      nine this morning taken up my quarters at the club. Please do not tell
      Carroll; it would only pain her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the station, just before they passed in to the train, the general
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there!&rdquo; he fussed. &ldquo;If your mother should hear of my being here,
      it would be a very bad business, very bad. This is very sad; but&mdash;well,
      good-bye, dear; and you, sir, be good to her. And write your daddy,
      Carroll. He'll be lonesome for you.&rdquo; He blew his nose very loudly and
      wiped his glasses. &ldquo;Now, run along, run along,&rdquo; he hurried them. &ldquo;Let us
      not have any scenes. Here, my dear, open this envelope when you are well
      started. It may help cheer the journey. Not a word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried them through the gate, paying no heed to what they were trying
      to say. Then he steamed away and bustled into a cab without once looking
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the train had passed the Harlem River and was swaying its uneven way
      across the open country, Carroll opened the envelope. It contained a check
      for a thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old daddy!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Our only wedding present!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the capitalist of the family,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;You don't know how
      poor a man you've married. I haven't much more than the proverbial silver
      watch and bad nickel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reached out to press his hand in reassurance. He compared it
      humorously with his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a homely, knotted, tanned old thing it is by yours,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a strong hand,&rdquo; she replied soberly, &ldquo;it's a dear hand.&rdquo; Suddenly
      she snatched it up and pressed it for a fleeting instant against her
      cheek, looking at him half ashamed.

      XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The winter months were spent at Monrovia, where Orde and his wife lived
      for a time at the hotel. This was somewhat expensive, but Orde was not
      quite ready to decide on a home, and he developed unexpected opposition to
      living at Redding in the Orde homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I've been thinking about it,&rdquo; he told Grandma Orde. &ldquo;A young couple
      should start out on their own responsibility. I know you'd be glad to have
      us, but I think it's better the other way. Besides, I must be at Monrovia
      a good deal of the time, and I want Carroll with me. She can make you a
      good long visit in the spring, when I have to go up river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Grandma Orde, being a wise old lady, had to nod her assent,
      although she would much have liked her son near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Monrovia, then, they took up their quarters. Carroll soon became
      acquainted with the life of the place. Monrovia, like most towns of its
      sort and size, consisted of an upper stratum of mill owners and lumber
      operators, possessed of considerable wealth, some cultivation, and
      definite social ideas; a gawky, countrified, middle estate of
      storekeepers, catering both to the farm and local trade and the lumber
      mill operatives, generally of Holland extraction, who dwelt in simple
      unpainted board shanties. The class first mentioned comprised a small
      coterie, among whom Carroll soon found two or three congenials&mdash;Edith
      Fuller, wife of the young cashier in the bank; Valerie Cathcart, whose
      husband had been killed in the Civil War; Clara Taylor, wife of the
      leading young lawyer of the village; and, strangely enough, Mina Heinzman,
      the sixteen-year-old daughter of old Heinzman, the lumberman. Nothing was
      more indicative of the absolute divorce of business and social life than
      the unbroken evenness of Carroll's friendship for the younger girl. Though
      later the old German and Orde locked in serious struggle on the river,
      they continued to meet socially quite as usual; and the daughter of one
      and the wife of the other never suspected anything out of the ordinary.
      This impersonality of struggle has always been characteristic of the
      pioneer business man's good-nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark received the news of his partner's sudden marriage without
      evincing any surprise, but with a sardonic gleam in one corner of his eye.
      He called promptly, conversed politely for a half hour, and then took his
      leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like him?&rdquo; asked Orde, when he had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks like a very shrewd man,&rdquo; replied Carroll, picking her words for
      fear of saying the wrong thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't like him,&rdquo; he stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't dislike him,&rdquo; said Carroll. &ldquo;I've not a thing against him. But we
      could never be in the slightest degree sympathetic. He and I don't&mdash;don't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't jibe,&rdquo; Orde finished for her. &ldquo;I didn't much think you would. Joe
      never was much of a society bug.&rdquo; It was on the tip of Carroll's tongue to
      reply that &ldquo;society bugs&rdquo; were not the only sort she could appreciate, but
      she refrained. She had begun to realise the extent of her influence over
      her husband's opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark did not live at the hotel. Early in the fall he had rented a small
      one-story house situated just off Main Street, set well back from the
      sidewalk among clumps of oleanders. Into this he retired as a snail into
      its shell. At first he took his meals at the hotel, but later he imported
      an impassive, secretive man-servant, who took charge of him completely.
      Neither master nor man made any friends, and in fact rebuffed all
      advances. One Sunday, Carroll and Orde, out for a walk, passed this quaint
      little place, with its picket fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go in and return Joe's call,&rdquo; suggested Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their knock at the door brought the calm valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newmark is h'out, sir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yes, sir, I'll tell him that you
      called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned away. As they sauntered down the little brick-laid walk,
      Carroll suddenly pressed close to her husband's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;I want a little house like that, for our very own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't afford it, sweetheart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to own,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;just to rent. It will be next best to having
      a home of our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd have to have a girl, dear,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;and we can't even afford
      that, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl!&rdquo; cried Carroll indignantly. &ldquo;For us two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't do the housework and the cooking,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;You've never
      done such a thing in your life, and I won't have my little girl slaving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't be slaving, it will be fun&mdash;just like play-housekeeping,&rdquo;
       protested Carroll. &ldquo;And I've got to learn some time. I was brought up most
      absurdly, and I realise it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see,&rdquo; said Orde vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject was dropped for the time being. Later Carroll brought it up
      again. She was armed with several sheets of hotel stationery, covered with
      figures showing how much cheaper it would be to keep house than to board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly make out a strong case&mdash;on paper,&rdquo; laughed Orde. &ldquo;If
      you buy a rooster and a hen, and she raises two broods, at the end of a
      year you'll have twenty-six; and if they all breed&mdash;even allowing
      half roosters&mdash;you'll have over three hundred; and if they all breed,
      you'll have about thirty-five hundred; and if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; cried Carroll, covering her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Orde equably, &ldquo;but that's the way it figures. Funny
      the earth isn't overrun with chickens, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thrust her tables of figures into her desk drawer. &ldquo;You're just making
      fun of me always,&rdquo; she said reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later Orde took her one block up the street to look at a tiny
      little house tucked on a fifty-foot lot beneath the shadow of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's mighty little,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'll have to go out in the hall to change
      my collar, and we couldn't have more than two people at a time to call on
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a dear!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I'm not so e-nor-mous myself, whatever YOU
      may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They ended by renting the little house, and Carroll took charge of it
      delightedly. What difficulties she overcame, and what laughable and
      cryable mistakes she made only those who have encountered a like situation
      could realise. She learned fast, however, and took a real pride in her
      tiny box of a home. A piano was, of course, out of the question, but the
      great golden harp occupied one corner, or rather one side, of the parlour.
      Standing thus enshrouded in its covering, it rather resembled an august
      and tremendous veiled deity. To Carroll's great delight, Orde used
      solemnly to go down on all fours and knock his forehead thrice on the
      floor before it when he entered the house at evening. When the very cold
      weather came and they had to light the base-burner stove, which Orde
      stoutly maintained occupied all the other half of the parlour, the harp's
      delicate constitution necessitated its standing in the hall. Nevertheless,
      Carroll had great comfort from it. While Orde was away at the office, she
      whispered through its mellow strings her great happiness, the dreams for
      her young motherhood which would come in the summer, the vague and
      lingering pain over the hapless but beloved ones she had left behind her
      in her other life. Then she arose refreshed, and went about the simple
      duties of her tiny domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter was severe. All the world was white. The piles of snow along
      the sidewalks grew until Carroll could hardly look over them. Great fierce
      winds swept in from the lake. Sometimes Orde and his wife drove two miles
      to the top of the sand hills, where first they had met in this their
      present home, and looked out beyond the tumbled shore ice to the
      steel-gray, angry waters. The wind pricked their faces, and, going home,
      the sleigh-bells jingled, the snowballs from the horses' hoofs hit against
      the dash, the cold air seared the inside of their nostrils. When Orde
      helped Carroll from beneath the warm buffalo robes, she held up to him a
      face glowing with colour, framed in the soft fluffy fur of a hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You darling!&rdquo; he cried, and stooped to kiss her smooth, cold cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had returned from the stable around the corner, he found the lit
      lamp throwing its modified light and shade over the little round table. He
      shook down the base-burner vigorously, thrust several billets of wood in
      its door, and turned to meet her eyes across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of fun being married, isn't it?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of,&rdquo; she admitted, nodding gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business of the firm was by now about in shape. All the boom
      arrangements had been made; the two tugs were in the water and their
      machinery installed; supplies and equipments were stored away; the foremen
      of the crews engaged, and the crews themselves pretty well picked out.
      Only there needed to build the wanigan, and to cart in the supplies for
      the upper river works before the spring break-up and the almost complete
      disappearance of the roads. Therefore, Orde had the good fortune of
      unusual leisure to enjoy these first months with his bride. They entered
      together the Unexplored Country, and found it more wonderful than they had
      dreamed. Almost before they knew it, January and February had flown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must pack up, sweetheart,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only yesterday that we came,&rdquo; she cried regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took the train for Redding, were installed in the gable room,
      explored together for three days the delights of the old-fashioned house,
      the spicy joys of Grandma Orde's and Amanda's cookery, the almost adoring
      adulation of the old folks. Then Orde packed his &ldquo;turkey,&rdquo; assumed his
      woods clothes, and marched off down the street carrying his bag on his
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks like an old tramp in that rig,&rdquo; said Grandma Orde, closing the
      storm door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks like a conqueror of wildernesses!&rdquo; cried Carroll, straining her
      eyes after his vanishing figure. Suddenly she darted after him, calling in
      her high, bird-like tones. He turned and came back to her. She clasped him
      by the shoulders, reluctant to let him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;You'll take better care of my sweetheart
      than you ever did of Jack Orde, won't you, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde had reconnoitred the river as a general reconnoitres his antagonist,
      and had made his dispositions as the general disposes of his army, his
      commissary, his reserves. At this point five men could keep the river
      clear; at that rapid it would require twenty; there a dozen would suffice
      for ordinary contingencies, and yet an emergency might call for thirty&mdash;those
      thirty must not be beyond reach. In his mind's eye he apportioned the
      sections of the upper river. Among the remoter wildernesses every section
      must have its driving camp. The crews of each, whether few or many, would
      be expected to keep clear and running their own &ldquo;beats&rdquo; on the river. As
      far as the rear crew should overtake these divisions, either it would
      absorb them or the members of them would be thrown forward beyond the
      lowermost beat, to take charge of a new division down stream. When the
      settled farm country or the little towns were reached, many of the driving
      camps would become unnecessary; the men could be boarded out at farms
      lying in their beats. A continual advance would progress toward the Lake,
      the drive crews passing and repassing each other like pigeons in the sown
      fields. Each of these sections would be in charge of a foreman, whose
      responsibility ceased with the delivery of the logs to the men next below.
      A walking boss would trudge continually the river trail, or ride the logs
      down stream, holding the correlation of these many units. Orde himself
      would drive up and down the river, overseeing the whole plan of campaign,
      throwing the camps forward, concentrating his forces here, spreading them
      elsewhere, keeping accurately in mind the entire situation so that he
      could say with full confidence: &ldquo;Open Dam Number One for three hours at
      nine o'clock; Dam Number Two for two hours and a half at ten thirty,&rdquo; and
      so on down the line; sure that the flood waters thus released would arrive
      at the right moment, would supplement each other, and would so space
      themselves as to accomplish the most work with the least waste. In that
      one point more than in any other showed the expert. The water was his
      ammunition, a definite and limited quantity of it. To &ldquo;get the logs out
      with the water&rdquo; was the last word of praise to be said for the river
      driver. The more logs, the greater the glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it can readily be seen, this matter was rather a campaign than a mere
      labour, requiring the men, the munitions, the organisation, the tactical
      ability, the strategy, the resourcefulness, the boldness, and the
      executive genius of a military commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all these things, and to the distribution of supplies and implements
      among the various camps, Orde had attended. The wanigan for the rear crew
      was built. The foremen and walking boss had been picked out. Everything
      was in readiness. Orde was satisfied with the situation except that he
      found himself rather short-handed. He had counted on three hundred men for
      his crews, but scrape and scratch as he would, he was unable to gather
      over two hundred and fifty. This matter was not so serious, however, as
      later, when the woods camps should break up, he would be able to pick up
      more workmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won't be rivermen like my old crew, though,&rdquo; said Orde regretfully
      to Tom North, the walking boss. &ldquo;I'd like to steal a few from some of
      those Muskegon outfits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Until the logs should be well adrift, Orde had resolved to boss the rear
      crew himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the rear was naturally the farthest up stream, Orde had taken also the
      contract to break the rollways belonging to Carlin, which in the season's
      work would be piled up on the bank. Thus he could get to work immediately
      at the break-up, and without waiting for some one else. The seven or eight
      million feet of lumber comprised in Carlin's drive would keep the men
      below busy until the other owners, farther down and up the tributaries,
      should also have put their season's cut afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ice went out early, to Orde's satisfaction. As soon as the river ran
      clear in its lower reaches he took his rear crew in to Carlin's rollways.
    </p>
    <p>
      This crew was forty in number, and had been picked from the best&mdash;a
      hard-bitten, tough band of veterans, weather beaten, scarred in numerous
      fights or by the backwoods scourge of small-pox, compact, muscular,
      fearless, loyal, cynically aloof from those not of their cult, out-spoken
      and free to criticise&mdash;in short, men to do great things under the
      strong leader, and to mutiny at the end of three days under the weak. They
      piled off the train at Sawyer's, stamped their feet on the board platform
      of the station, shouldered their &ldquo;turkeys,&rdquo; and straggled off down the
      tote-road. It was an eighteen-mile walk in. The ground had loosened its
      frost. The footing was ankle-deep in mud and snow-water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, bright and early, the breaking of the rollways began. During
      the winter the logs had been hauled down ice roads to the river, where
      they were &ldquo;banked&rdquo; in piles twenty, and even thirty, feet in height. The
      bed of the stream itself was filled with them for a mile, save in a narrow
      channel left down through the middle to allow for some flow of water; the
      banks were piled with them, side on, ready to roll down at the urging of
      the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, the entire crew set itself, by means of its peavies, to
      rolling the lower logs into the current, where they were rapidly borne
      away. As the waters were now at flood, this was a quick and easy labour.
      Occasionally some tiers would be stuck together by ice, in which case
      considerable prying and heaving was necessary in order to crack them
      apart. But forty men, all busily at work, soon had the river full. Orde
      detailed some six or eight to drop below in order that the river might run
      clear to the next section, where the next crew would take up the task.
      These men, quite simply, walked to the edges of the rollway, rolled a log
      apiece into the water, stepped aboard, leaned against their peavies, and
      were swept away by the swift current. The logs on which they stood whirled
      in the eddies, caromed against other timbers, slackened speed, shot away;
      never did the riders alter their poses of easy equilibrium. From time to
      time one propelled his craft ashore by hooking to and pushing against
      other logs. There he stood on some prominent point, leaning his chin
      contemplatively against the thick shaft of his peavy, watching the endless
      procession of the logs drifting by. Apparently he was idle, but in reality
      his eyes missed no shift of the ordered ranks. When a slight hitch or
      pause, a subtle change in the pattern of the brown carpet caught his
      attention, he sprang into life. Balancing his peavy across his body, he
      made his way by short dashes to the point of threatened congestion. There,
      working vigorously, swept down stream with the mass, he pulled, hauled,
      and heaved, forcing the heavy, reluctant timbers from the cohesion that
      threatened trouble later. Oblivious to his surroundings, he wrenched and
      pried desperately. The banks of the river drifted by. Point succeeded
      point, as though withdrawn up stream by some invisible manipulator. The
      river appeared stationary, the banks in motion. Finally he heard at his
      elbow the voice of the man stationed below him, who had run out from his
      own point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Bill,&rdquo; he replied to this man, &ldquo;you old slough hog! Tie into this
      this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the time!&rdquo; agreed Bill cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the danger was averted, the logs ran free. The rivermen
      thereupon made their uncertain way back to shore, where they took the
      river trail up stream again to their respective posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon they ate lunches they had brought with them in little canvas bags,
      snatched before they left the rollways from a supply handy by the cook. In
      the meantime the main crew were squatting in the lea of the brush,
      devouring a hot meal which had been carried to them in wooden boxes
      strapped to the backs of the chore boys. Down the river and up its
      tributaries other crews, both in the employ of Newmark and Orde and of
      others, were also pausing from their cold and dangerous toil. The river,
      refreshed after its long winter, bent its mighty back to the great annual
      burden laid upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the second day the logs actually in the bed of the stream
      had been shaken loose, and a large proportion of them had floated entirely
      from sight. It now became necessary to break down the rollways piled along
      the tops of the banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of this day, however, Orde received a visit from Jim Denning,
      the foreman of the next section below, bringing with him Charlie, the cook
      of Daly's last year's drive. Leaving him by the larger fire, Jim Denning
      drew his principal one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fellow drifted in to-night two days late after a drunk, and he tells
      an almighty queer story,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He says a crew of bad men from the
      Saginaw, sixty strong, have been sent in by Heinzman. He says Heinzman
      hired them to come over not to work, but just to fight and annoy us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so?&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;Well, where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know. But he sticks by his story, and tells it pretty straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring him over, and let's hear it,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Charlie!&rdquo; he greeted the cook when the latter stood before him.
      &ldquo;What's this yarn Jim's telling me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's straight, Mr. Orde,&rdquo; said the cook. &ldquo;There's a big crew brought in
      from the Saginaw Waters to do you up. They're supposed to be over here to
      run his drive, but really they're goin' to fight and raise hell. For why
      would he want sixty men to break out them little rollways of his'n up at
      the headwaters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that where they've gone?&rdquo; asked Orde like a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. And he only owns a 'forty' up there, and it ain't more'n half
      cut, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know he owned any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. He bought that little Johnson piece last winter. I been workin'
      up there with a little two-horse crew since January. We didn't put up
      more'n a couple hundred thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he breaking out his rollways below?&rdquo; Orde asked Denning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; struck in Charlie, &ldquo;he ain't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you happen to be so wise?&rdquo; inquired Orde, &ldquo;Seems to me you know
      about as much as old man Solomon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; explained Charlie, &ldquo;you see it's like this. When I got back from
      the woods last week, I just sort of happened into McNeill's place. I
      wasn't drinkin' a drop!&rdquo; he cried virtuously, in answer to Orde's smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;I was just thinking of the last time we were
      in there together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just it!&rdquo; cried Charlie. &ldquo;They was always sore at you about that.
      Well, I was lyin' on one of those there benches back of the 'Merican flags
      in the dance hall 'cause I was very sleepy, when in blew old man Heinzman
      and McNeill himself. I just lay low for black ducks and heard their talk.
      They took a look around, but didn't see no one, so they opened her up
      wide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you hear?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, McNeill he agreed to get a gang of bad ones from the Saginaw to run
      in on the river, and I heard Heinzman tell him to send 'em in to
      headwaters. And McNeill said, 'That's all right about the cash, Mr.
      Heinzman, but I been figgerin' on gettin' even with Orde for some
      myself.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; inquired Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about all,&rdquo; confessed Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know he didn't hire them to carry down his drive for him? He'd
      need sixty men for his lower rollways, and maybe they weren't all to go to
      headwaters?&rdquo; asked Orde by way of testing Charlie's beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's payin' them four dollars a day,&rdquo; replied Charlie simply. &ldquo;Now, who'd
      pay that fer just river work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde nodded at Jim Denning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Charlie,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why are you giving all this away if you were
      working for Heinzman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm working for you now,&rdquo; replied Charlie with dignity. &ldquo;And, besides,
      you helped me out once yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it's a straight tip all right,&rdquo; said Orde to Denning, when the
      cook had resumed his place by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I thought. That's why I brought him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that crew's been sent in there, it means only one thing at that end of
      the line,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. They're sent up to waste out the water in the reservoir and hang
      this end of the drive,&rdquo; replied Denning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;The old skunk knows his own rollways are so far
      down stream that he's safe, flood water or no flood water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause ensued, during which the two smoked vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do about it?&rdquo; asked Denning at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; countered Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Denning slowly, and with a certain grim joy, &ldquo;I don't bet
      those Saginaw river-pigs are any more two-fisted than the boys on this
      river. I'd go up and clean 'em out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't do,&rdquo; negatived Orde briefly. &ldquo;In the first place, as you know very
      well, we're short-handed now, and we can't spare the men from the work. In
      the second place, we'd hang up sure, then; to go up in that wilderness,
      fifty miles from civilisation, would mean a first-class row of too big a
      size to handle. Won't do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you get a lawyer,&rdquo; suggested Denning sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde laughed with great good-humour
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where'd our water be by the time he got an injunction for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell into a brown study, during which his pipe went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;it isn't a fair game. I don't know what to do.
      Delay will hang us; taking men off the work will hang us. I've just got to
      go up there myself and see what can be done by talking to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking to them!&rdquo; Denning snorted. &ldquo;You might as well whistle down the
      draught-pipe of hell! If they're just up there for a row, there'll be
      whisky in camp; and you can bet McNeill's got some of 'em instructed on
      YOUR account. They'll kill you, sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you it's risky,&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;I'm scared; I'm willing to
      admit it. But I don't see what else to do. Of course he's got no rights,
      but what the hell good does that do us after our water is gone? And Jim,
      my son, if we hang this drive, I'll be buried so deep I never will dig
      out. No; I've got to go. You can stay up here in charge of the rear until
      I get back. Send word by Charlie who's to boss your division while you're
      gone.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde tramped back to Sawyer's early next morning, hitched into the light
      buckboard the excellent team with which later, when the drive should
      spread out, he would make his longest jumps, and drove to head-waters. He
      arrived in sight of the dam about three o'clock. At the edge of the
      clearing he pulled up to survey the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of three small log-cabins marked the Johnson, and later the
      Heinzman, camp. From the chimneys a smoke arose. Twenty or thirty rivermen
      lounged about the sunny side of the largest structure. They had evidently
      just arrived, for some of their &ldquo;turkeys&rdquo; were still piled outside the
      door. Orde clucked to his horses, and the spidery wheels of the buckboard
      swung lightly over the wet hummocks of the clearing, to come to a stop
      opposite the men. Orde leaned forward against his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, boys!&rdquo; said he cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one replied, though two or three nodded surlily. Orde looked them over
      with some interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a dirty, unkempt, unshaven, hard-looking lot, with bloodshot
      eyes, a flicker of the dare-devil in expression, beyond the first youth,
      hardened into an enduring toughness of fibre&mdash;bad men from the
      Saginaw, in truth, and, unless Orde was mistaken, men just off a drunk,
      and therefore especially dangerous; men eager to fight at the drop of the
      hat, or sooner, to be accommodating, and ready to employ in their assaults
      all the formidable and terrifying weapons of the rough-and-tumble;
      reckless, hard, irreverrent, blasphemous, to be gained over by no words,
      fair or foul; absolutely scornful of any and all institutions imposed on
      them by any other but the few men whom they acknowledged as their leaders.
      And to master these men's respect there needed either superlative
      strength, superlative recklessness, or superlative skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's your boss?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Rough Red,&rdquo; growled one of the men without moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde had heard of this man, of his personality and his deeds. Like Silver
      Jack of the Muskegon, his exploits had been celebrated in song. A big,
      broad-faced man, with a red beard, they had told him, with little,
      flickering eyes, a huge voice that bellowed through the woods in a torrent
      of commands and imprecations, strong as a bull, and savage as a wild
      beast. A hint of his quality will suffice from the many stories circulated
      about him. It was said that while jobbing for Morrison and Daly, in some
      of that firm's Saginaw Valley holdings, the Rough Red had discovered that
      a horse had gone lame. He called the driver of that team before him,
      seized an iron starting bar, and with it broke the man's leg. &ldquo;Try th'
      lameness yourself, Barney Mallan,&rdquo; said he. To appeal to the charity of
      such a man would be utterly useless. Orde saw this point. He picked up his
      reins and spoke to his team.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the horses had taken three steps, a huge riverman had planted
      himself squarely in the way. The others rising, slowly surrounded the rig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you're up here for,&rdquo; growled the man at the horses'
      heads, &ldquo;but you wanted to see the boss, and I guess you'd better see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to see him,&rdquo; said Orde sharply. &ldquo;Get out of the way and let me
      hitch my team.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drove deliberately ahead, forcing the man to step aside, and stopped
      his horses by a stub. He tied them there and descended, to lean his back
      also against the log walls of the little house.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments a huge form appeared above the river bank at some
      forty rods' distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonder he comes now,&rdquo; vouchsafed the man nearest Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde made out the great square figure of the boss, his soft hat, his
      flaming red beard, his dingy mackinaw coat, his dingy black-and-white
      checked flannel shirt, his dingy blue trousers tucked into high socks,
      and, instead of driving boots, his ordinary lumberman's rubbers. As a spot
      of colour, he wore a flaming red knit sash, with tassels. Before he had
      approached near enough to be plainly distinguishable, he began to bellow
      at the men, commanding them, with a mighty array of oaths, to wake up and
      get the sluice-gate open. In a moment or so he had disappeared behind some
      bushes that intervened in his approach to the house. His course through
      them could be traced by the top of his cap, which just showed above them.
      In a moment he thrust through the brush and stood before Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stared at the young man, and then, with a wild Irish yell,
      leaped upon him. Orde, caught unawares and in an awkward position, was
      hardly able even to struggle against the gigantic riverman. Indeed, before
      he had recovered his faculties to the point of offering determined
      resistance, he was pinned back against the wall by his shoulders, and the
      Rough Red's face was within two feet of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are ye, ye ould darlint?&rdquo; shouted the latter, with a roll of
      oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jimmy Bourke!&rdquo; cried Orde, and burst into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rough Red jerked him to his feet, delivered a bear hug that nearly
      crushed his ribs, and pounded him mightily on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ould snoozer!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;Where the blankety blank in blank did
      you come from? Byes,&rdquo; he shouted to the men, &ldquo;it's me ould boss on th' Au
      Sable six year back&mdash;that time, ye mind, whin we had th' ice jam!
      Glory be! but I'm glad to see ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde was still laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know you'd turned into the Rough Red, Jimmy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don't
      believe we were either of us old enough for whiskers then, were we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rough Red grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for ye!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And what have ye been doing all these years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just it, Jimmy,&rdquo; said Orde, drawing the giant one side, out of
      ear-shot. &ldquo;All my eggs are in one basket, and it's a mean trick of you to
      hire out for filthy lucre to kick that basket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do ye mane?&rdquo; asked the Rough Red, fixing his twinkling little eyes
      on Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to tell me,&rdquo; countered Orde, glancing down at the other's
      rubber-shod feet, &ldquo;that this crew has been sent up here just to break out
      those measly little rollways?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thim?&rdquo; said the Rough Red. &ldquo;Thim? Hell, NO! Thim's my bodyguard. They can
      lick their weight in wild cats, and I'd loike well to see the gang of
      highbankers that infists this river thry to pry thim out. We weren't sint
      here to wurrk; we were sint here to foight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight? Why?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I dunno,&rdquo; replied the Rough Red easily. &ldquo;Me boss and the blank of a
      blank blanked blank that's attimptin' to droive this river has some sort
      of a row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;didn't you know that I am the gentleman last
      mentioned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm driving this river, and that's my dam-keeper you've got hid away
      somewhere here, and that's my water you're planning to waste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; repeated the Rough Red, but in a different tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a tone of vast astonishment, the Rough Red mentioned his probable
      deserts in the future life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luk here, Jack,&rdquo; said he after a moment, &ldquo;here's a crew of white-water
      birlers that ye can't beat nowheres. What do you want us to do? We're now
      gettin' four dollars a day AN' board from that murderin' ould villain,
      Heinzman, SO WE CAN AFFORD TO WURRK FOR YOU CHEAP.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please do now, darlint!&rdquo; wheedled the Rough Red, his little eyes
      agleam with mischief. &ldquo;Sind us some oakum and pitch and we'll caulk yure
      wanigan for ye. Or maybe some more peavies, and we'll hilp ye on yure
      rollways. And till us, afore ye go, how ye want this dam, and that's the
      way she'll be. Come, now, dear! and ain't ye short-handed now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde slapped his knee and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is sure one hell of a joke!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ain't it now?&rdquo; said the Rough Red, smiling with as much ingratiation
      as he was able.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take you boys on,&rdquo; said Orde at last, &ldquo;at the usual wages&mdash;dollar
      and a half for the jam, three for the rear. I doubt if you'll see much of
      Heinzman's money when this leaks out.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thus Orde, by the sheer good luck that sometimes favours men engaged in
      large enterprises, not only frustrated a plan likely to bring failure to
      his interests, but filled up his crews. It may be remarked here, as well
      as later, that the &ldquo;terrors of the Saginaw&rdquo; stayed with the drive to its
      finish, and proved reliable and tractable in every particular. Orde
      scattered them judiciously, so there was no friction with the local men.
      The Rough Red he retained on the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the breaking of the rollways had reached a stage more exciting both
      to onlooker and participant than the mere opening of the river channel.
      Huge stacks of logs piled sidewise to the bank lined the stream for miles.
      When the lowermost log on the river side was teased and pried out, the
      upper tiers were apt to cascade down with a roar, a crash, and a splash.
      The man who had done the prying had to be very quick-eyed, very cool, and
      very agile to avoid being buried under the tons of timber that rushed down
      on him. Only the most reliable men were permitted at this initial breaking
      down. Afterwards the crew rolled in what logs remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rough Red's enormous strength, dare-devil spirit, and nimbleness of
      body made him invaluable at this dangerous work. Orde, too, often took a
      hand in some of the more ticklish situations. In old days, before he had
      attained the position of responsibility that raised the value of his time
      beyond manual work, he had been one of the best men on the river at
      breaking bank rollways. A slim, graceful, handsome boy of twenty, known as
      &ldquo;Rollway Charlie,&rdquo; also distinguished himself by the quickness and
      certainty of his work. Often the men standing near lost sight of him
      entirely in the spray, the confusion, the blur of the breaking rollways,
      until it seemed certain he must have perished. Nevertheless, always he
      appeared at right or left, sometimes even on a log astream, nonchalant,
      smiling, escaped easily from the destructive power he had loosed. Once in
      the stream the logs ran their appointed course, watched by the men who
      herded them on their way. And below, from the tributaries, from the other
      rollways a never-ending procession of recruits joined this great brown
      army on its way to the lake, until for miles and miles the river was
      almost a solid mass of logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crews on the various beats now had their hands full to keep the logs
      running. The slightest check at any one point meant a jam, for there was
      no way of stopping the unending procession. The logs behind floated gently
      against the obstruction and came to rest. The brown mass thickened. As far
      as the eye could reach the surface of the water was concealed. And then,
      as the slow pressure developed from the three or four miles of logs forced
      against each other by the pushing of the current, the breast of the jam
      began to rise. Timbers up-ended, crossed, interlocked, slid one over the
      other, mounted higher and higher in the formidable game of jack-straws the
      loss of which spelled death to the players.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately, and with feverish activity, the men nearest at hand attacked
      the work. Logs on top they tumbled and rolled into the current below. Men
      beneath the breast tugged and pried in search of the key logs causing all
      the trouble. Others &ldquo;flattened out the wings,&rdquo; hoping to get a &ldquo;draw&rdquo;
       around the ends. As the stoppage of the drive indicated to the men up and
      down stream that a jam had formed, they gathered at the scene&mdash;those
      from above over the logs, those from below up the river trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rarely, unless in case of unusual complications, did it take more than a
      few hours at most to break the jam. The breast of it went out with a rush.
      More slowly the wings sucked in. Reluctantly the mass floating on the
      surface for miles up stream stirred, silently moved forward. For a few
      minutes it was necessary to watch carefully until the flow onward steadied
      itself, until the congestion had spaced and ordered as before. Then the
      men moved back to their posts; the drive was resumed. At night the river
      was necessarily left to its own devices. Rivermen, with the touch of
      superstition inseparably connected with such affairs, believe implicitly
      that &ldquo;logs run free at night.&rdquo; Certainly, though it might be expected that
      each morning would reveal a big jam to break, such was rarely the case.
      The logs had usually stopped, to be sure, but generally in so peaceful a
      situation as easily to be started on by a few minutes' work. Probably this
      was because they tended to come to rest in the slow, still reaches of the
      river, through which, in daytime, they would be urged by the rivermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jams on the river, contrary to general belief, are of very common
      occurrence. Throughout the length of the drive there were probably three
      or four hang-ups a day. Each of these had to be broken, and in the
      breaking was danger. The smallest misstep, the least slowness in reading
      the signs of the break, the slightest lack of promptness in acting on the
      hint or of agility in leaping from one to the other of the plunging
      timbers, the faintest flicker from rigid attention to the antagonist
      crouching on the spring, would mean instant death to the delinquent. Thus
      it was literally true that each one of these men was called upon almost
      daily to wager his personal skill against his destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the rear was &ldquo;sacking&rdquo; its way as fast as possible, moving
      camp with the wanigan whenever necessary, working very hard and very cold
      and very long. In its work, however, beyond the breaking of the rollways,
      was little of the spectacular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde, after the rear was well started, patrolled the length of the drive
      in his light buckboard. He had a first-class team of young horses&mdash;high-spirited,
      somewhat fractious, but capable on a pinch of their hundred miles in a
      day. He handled them well over the rough corduroys and swamp roads. From
      jam to rear and back again he travelled, pausing on the river banks to
      converse earnestly with one of the foremen, surveying the situation with
      the bird's-eye view of the general. At times he remained at one camp for
      several days watching the trend of the work. The improvements made during
      the preceding summer gave him the greatest satisfaction, especially the
      apron at the falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd have had a dozen bad jams here before now with all these logs in the
      river,&rdquo; said he to Tim Nolan, who was in charge of that beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as it is,&rdquo; said Tim, &ldquo;we've had but the one little wing jam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The piers to define the channel along certain shallows also saved the rear
      crew much labour in the matter of stranded logs. Everything was very
      satisfactory. Even old man Reed held to his chastened attitude, and made
      no trouble. In fact, he seemed glad to turn an honest penny by boarding
      the small crew in charge of sluicing the logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      No trouble was experienced until Heinzman's rollways were reached. Here
      Orde had, as he had promised his partner, boomed a free channel to prevent
      Heinzman from filling up the entire river-bed with his rollways. When the
      jam of the drive had descended the river as far as this, Orde found that
      Heinzman had not yet begun to break out. Hardly had Orde's first crew
      passed, however, when Heinzman's men began to break down the logs into the
      drive. Long before the rear had caught up, all Heinzman's drive was in the
      water, inextricably mingled with the sixty or eighty million feet Orde had
      in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was plain. All Heinzman now had to do was to retain a small
      crew, which should follow after the rear in order to sack what logs the
      latter should leave stranded. This amounted practically to nothing. As it
      was impossible in so great a mass of timbers, and in the haste of a
      pressing labour, to distinguish or discriminate against any single brand,
      Heinzman was in a fair way to get his logs sent down stream with
      practically no expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, my boy,&rdquo; remarked the German quite frankly to Orde as they met on
      the road one day, &ldquo;looks like I got you dis time, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde laughed, also with entire good-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean your logs are going down with ours, why I guess you have. But
      you paste this in your hat: you're going to keep awful busy, and it's
      going to cost you something yet to get 'em down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Newmark, on one of his occasional visits to the camps, Orde detailed
      the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't amount to much,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;except that it complicates matters.
      We'll make him scratch gravel, if we have to sit up nights and work
      overtime to do it. We can't injure him or leave his logs, but we can annoy
      him a lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The state of affairs was perfectly well known to the men, and the entire
      river entered into the spirit of the contest. The drivers kept a sharp
      lookout for &ldquo;H&rdquo; logs, and whenever possible thrust them aside into eddies
      and backwaters. This, of course, merely made work for the sackers Heinzman
      had left above the rear. Soon they were in charge of a very fair little
      drive of their own. Their lot was not enviable. Indeed, only the pressure
      of work prevented some of the more aggressive of Orde's rear&mdash;among
      whom could be numbered the Rough Red&mdash;from going back and &ldquo;cleaning
      out&rdquo; this impertinent band of hangers-on. One day two of the latter,
      conducting the jam of the miniature drive astern, came within reach of the
      Rough Red. The latter had lingered in hopes of rescuing his peavy, which
      had gone overboard. To lose one's peavy is, among rivermen, the most
      mortifying disgrace. Consequently, the Rough Red was in a fit mood for
      trouble. He attacked the two single-handed. A desperate battle ensued,
      which lasted upward of an hour. The two rivermen punched, kicked, and
      battered the Rough Red in a manner to tear his clothes, deprive him to
      some extent of red whiskers, bloody his face, cut his shoulder, and knock
      loose two teeth. The Rough Red, more than the equal of either man singly,
      had reciprocated in kind. Orde, driving in toward the rear from a detour
      to avoid a swamp, heard, and descended from his buckboard. Tying his
      horses to trees, he made his way through the brush to the scene of
      conflict. So winded and wearied were the belligerents by now that he had
      no difficulty in separating them. He surveyed their wrecks with a sardonic
      half smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call this a draw,&rdquo; said he finally. His attitude became threatening as
      the two up-river men, recovering somewhat, showed ugly symptoms. &ldquo;Git!&rdquo; he
      commanded. &ldquo;Scat! I guess you don't know me. I'm Jack Orde. Jimmy and I
      together could do a dozen of you.&rdquo; He menaced them until, muttering, they
      had turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jimmy,&rdquo; said he humorously, &ldquo;you look as if you'd been run through
      a thrashing machine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those fellers make me sick!&rdquo; growled the Rough Red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked him over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look sick,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the buckboard drew into camp, Orde sent Bourke away to repair damages
      while he called the cookee to help unpack several heavy boxes of hardware.
      They proved to contain about thirty small hatchets, well sharpened, and
      each with a leather guard. When the rear crew had come in that night, Orde
      distributed the hatchets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;while you're on the work, I want you all to keep a
      watch-out for these &ldquo;H&rdquo; logs, and whenever you strike one I want you to
      blaze it plainly, so there won't be any mistake about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked one of the Saginaw men as he received his hatchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the riverman who squatted next nudged him with his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The less questions you ask Jack, the more answers you'll get. Just do
      what you're told to on this river and you'll see fun sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three days later the rear crew ran into the head of the pond above Reed's
      dam. To every one's surprise, Orde called a halt on the work and announced
      a holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, holidays are unknown on drive. Barely is time allowed for eating and
      sleeping. Nevertheless, all that day the men lay about in complete
      idleness, smoking, talking, sleeping in the warm sun. The river, silenced
      by the closed sluice-gates, slept also. The pond filled with logs. From
      above, the current, aided by a fair wind, was driving down still other
      logs&mdash;the forerunners of the little drive astern. At sight of these,
      some of the men grumbled. &ldquo;We're losin' what we made,&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;We left
      them logs, and sorted 'em out once already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde sent a couple of axe-men to blaze the newcomers. A little before
      sundown he ordered the sluice-gates of the dam opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Night work,&rdquo; said the men to one another. They knew, of course, that in
      sluicing logs, the gate must be open a couple of hours before the sluicing
      begins in order to fill the river-bed below. Logs run ahead faster than
      the water spreads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, after supper Orde suddenly appeared among them, the
      well-known devil of mischief dancing in his eyes and broadening his
      good-natured face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get organised, boys,&rdquo; said he briskly. &ldquo;We've got to get this pond all
      sluiced before morning, and there's enough of us here to hustle it right
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men took their places. Orde moved here and there, giving his
      directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sluice through everything but the &ldquo;H&rdquo; logs,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Work them off
      to the left and leave them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twilight, then dark, fell. After a few moments the moon, then just past
      its full, rose behind the new-budding trees. The sluicing, under the
      impetus of a big crew, went rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet there's mighty near a million an hour going through there,&rdquo;
       speculated Orde, watching the smooth, swift, but burdened waters of the
      chute.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this work the men distinguished easily the new white blaze-marks on
      Heinzman's logs; so they were able without hesitation to shunt them one
      side into the smoother water, as Orde had commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two o'clock the last log shot through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;tear out the booms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chute to the dam was approached, as has been earlier explained, by two
      rows of booms arranged in a V, or funnel, the apex of which emptied into
      the sluice-way, and the wide, projecting arms of which embraced the width
      of the stream. The logs, floating down the pond, were thus concentrated
      toward the sluice. Also, the rivermen, walking back and forth the length
      of the booms, were able easily to keep the drive moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, Orde unchained these boom logs. The men pushed them ashore.
      There as many as could find room on either side the boom-poles clamped in
      their peavies, and, using these implements as handles, carried the booms
      some distance back into the woods. Then everybody tramped back and forth,
      round and about, to confuse the trail. Orde was like a mischievous boy at
      a school prank. When the last timber had been concealed, he lifted up his
      deep voice in a roar of joy, in which the crew joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let's turn in for a little sleep,&rdquo; said be.
    </p>
    <p>
      This situation, perhaps a little cloudy in the reader's mind, would have
      cleared could he have looked out over the dam pond the following morning.
      The blazed logs belonging to Heinzman, drifting slowly, had sucked down
      into the corner toward the power canal where, caught against the grating,
      they had jammed. These logs would have to be floated singly, and pushed
      one by one against the current across the pond and into the influence of
      the sluice-gate. Some of them would be hard to come at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that will keep them busy for a day or two,&rdquo; commented Orde, as he
      followed the rear down to where it was sacking below the dam.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, as Orde had said, would be sufficiently annoying to Heinzman, but
      would have little real effect on the main issue, which was that the German
      was getting down his logs with a crew of less than a dozen men.
      Nevertheless, Orde, in a vast spirit of fun, took delight in inventing and
      executing practical jokes of the general sort just described. For
      instance, at one spot where he had boomed the deeper channel from the
      rocks on either side, he shunted as many of Heinzman's logs as came by
      handily through an opening he had made in the booms. There they grounded
      on the shallows&mdash;more work for the men following. Many of the logs in
      charge of the latter, however, catching the free current, overtook the
      rear, so that the number of the &ldquo;H&rdquo; logs in the drive was not materially
      diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, as has been hinted, these various tactics had little effect. One
      day, however, the chore boy, who had been over to Spruce Rapids after
      mail, reported that an additional crew of twenty had been sent in to
      Heinzman's drive. This was gratifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're making him scratch gravel, boys, anyway,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men entered into the spirit of the thing. In fact, their enthusiasm
      was almost too exuberant. Orde had constantly to negative new and
      ingenious schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I want to keep on the right side of the law. We may
      need it later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the entire length of the river was busy and excited. Heinzman's
      logs were all blazed inside a week. The men passed the hatchets along the
      line, and slim chance did a marked log have of rescue once the poor thing
      fell into difficulties. With the strange and interesting tendency rivermen
      and woodsmen have of personifying the elements of their daily work, the
      men addressed the helpless timbers in tones of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought you'd ride that rock, you &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo;
       said they, &ldquo;and got left, did you? Well, lie there and be &mdash;&mdash;
      to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And if chance offered, and time was not pressing, the riverman would give
      his helpless victim a jerk or so into a more difficult position. Times of
      rising water&mdash;when the sluice-gates above had been opened&mdash;were
      the most prolific of opportunities. Logs rarely jam on rising water, for
      the simple reason that constantly the surface area of the river is
      increasing, thus tending to separate the logs. On the other hand, falling
      water, tending to crowd the drive closer together, is especially prolific
      of trouble. Therefore, on flood water the watchers scattered along the
      stretches of the river had little to do&mdash;save strand Heinzman's logs
      for him. And when flood water had passed, some of those logs were
      certainly high and dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to a certain point this was all very well. Orde took pains not to
      countenance it officially, and caused word to be passed about, that while
      he did not expect his men to help drive Heinzman's logs, they must not go
      out of their way to strand them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If things get too bad, he'll have spies down here to collect evidence on
      us,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;and he'll jug some of us for interference with his
      property. We don't own the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about them booms?&rdquo; asked the Rough Red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did own them,&rdquo; explained Orde, &ldquo;and I had a right to take them up when
      I had finished with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This hint was enough. The men did not cease from a labour that tickled
      them mightily, but they adopted a code of signals. Strangers were not
      uncommon. Spectators came out often from the little towns and from the
      farms round-about. When one of these appeared the riverman nearest raised
      a long falsetto cry. This was taken up by his next neighbour and passed
      on. In a few minutes all that section of the drive knew that it would be
      wise to &ldquo;lie low.&rdquo; And inside of two weeks Orde had the great satisfaction
      of learning that Heinzman was working&mdash;and working hard&mdash;a crew
      of fifty men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty fair crew, even if he was taking out his whole drive,&rdquo; commented
      Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gods of luck seemed to be with the new enterprise. Although Orde had,
      of course, taken the utmost pains to foresee every contingency possible to
      guard against, nevertheless, as always when dealing with Nature's larger
      forces, he anticipated some of those gigantic obstacles which continually
      render uncertain wilderness work. Nothing of the kind happened. There
      formed none of the tremendous white-water jams that pile up several
      million feet of logs, tax every resource of men, horses, and explosives,
      and require a week or so to break. No men were killed, and only two
      injured. No unexpected floods swept away works on which the drive
      depended. The water held out to carry the last stick of timber over the
      shallowest rapids. Weather conditions were phenomenal&mdash;and perfect.
      All up and down the river the work went with that vim and dash that is in
      itself an assurance of success. The Heinzman affair, which under auspices
      of evil augury might have become a serious menace to the success of the
      young undertaking, now served merely to add a spice of humour to the
      situation. Among the men gained currency a half-affectionate belief in
      &ldquo;Orde's luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this happy fashion the drive went, until at last it entered the
      broad, deep, and navigable stretches of the river from Redding to the
      lake. Here, barring the accident of an extraordinary flood, the troubles
      were over. On the broad, placid bosom of the stream the logs would float.
      A crew, following, would do the easy work of sacking what logs would
      strand or eddy in the lazy current; would roll into the faster waters the
      component parts of what were by courtesy called jams, but which were in
      reality pile-ups of a few hundred logs on sand bars mid-stream; and in the
      growing tepid warmth of summer would tramp pleasantly along the river
      trail. Of course, a dry year would make necessary a larger crew and more
      labour; of course, a big flood might sweep the logs past all defences into
      the lake for an irretrievable loss. But such floods come once in a
      century, and even the dryest of dry years could not now hang the drive. As
      Orde sat in his buckboard, ready to go into town for a first glimpse of
      Carroll in more than two months, he gazed with an immense satisfaction
      over the broad river moving brown and glacier-like as though the logs that
      covered it were viscid and composed all its substance. The enterprise was
      practically assured of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while now Orde was to have a breathing spell. A large number of men
      were here laid off. The remainder, under the direction of Jim Denning,
      would require little or no actual supervision. Until the jam should have
      reached the distributing booms above Monrovia, the affair was very simple.
      Before he left, however, he called Denning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I'll be down to see you through the sluiceways at
      Redding, of course. But now that you have a good, still stretch of river,
      I want you to have the boys let up on sacking out those &ldquo;H&rdquo; logs. And I
      want you to include in our drive all the Heinzman logs from above you
      possibly can. If you can fix it, let their drive drift down into ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we'll have to drive their logs for them,&rdquo; objected Denning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; rejoined Orde, &ldquo;but it's easy driving; and if that crew of his
      hasn't much to do, perhaps he'll lay most of them off here at Redding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denning looked at his principal for a moment, then a slow grin overspread
      his face. Without comment he turned back to camp, and Orde took up his
      reins.

    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm so GLAD to get you back!&rdquo; cried Carroll over and over again, as
      she clung to him. &ldquo;I don't live while you're away. And every drop of rain
      that patters on the roof chills my heart, because I think of it as
      chilling you; and every creak of this old house at night brings me up
      broad awake, because I hear in it the crash of those cruel great timbers.
      Oh, oh, OH! I'm so glad to get you! You're the light of my life; you're my
      whole life itself!&rdquo;&mdash;she smiled at him from her perch on his knee&mdash;&ldquo;I'm
      silly, am I not?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Dear heart, don't leave me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to support an extravagant wife, you know,&rdquo; Orde reminded her
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, of course,&rdquo; she breathed, bending lightly to him. &ldquo;You have your
      work in the world to do, and I would not have it otherwise. It is great
      work&mdash;wonderful work&mdash;I've been asking questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's work, just like any other. And it's hard work,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head at him slowly, a mysterious smile on her lips. Without
      explaining her thought, she slipped from his knee and glided across to the
      tall golden harp, which had been brought from Monrovia. The light and
      diaphanous silk of her loose peignoir floated about her, defining the
      maturing grace of her figure. Abruptly she struck a great crashing chord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with an abandon of ecstasy she plunged into one of those wild and
      sea-blown saga-like rhapsodies of the Hungarians, full of the wind in
      rigging, the storm in the pines, of shrieking, vast forces hurtling
      unchained through a resounding and infinite space, as though deep down in
      primeval nature the powers of the world had been loosed. Back and forth,
      here and there, erratic and swift and sudden as lightning the theme played
      breathless. It fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; gasped Orde, surprised to find himself tense, his blood
      rioting, his soul stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran to him to hide her face in his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you, you, you!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her to him closely until her excitement had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it is good to get quite so nervous, sweetheart?&rdquo; he asked
      gently, then. &ldquo;Remember&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do, I do!&rdquo; she broke in earnestly. &ldquo;Every moment of my waking and
      sleeping hours I remember him. Always I keep his little soul before me as
      a light on a shrine. But to-night&mdash;oh! to-night I could laugh and
      shout aloud like the people in the Bible, with clapping of hands.&rdquo; She
      snuggled herself close to Orde with a little murmur of happiness. &ldquo;I think
      of all the beautiful things,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;and of the noble things, and
      of the great things. He is going to be sturdy, like his father; a
      wonderful boy, a boy all of fire&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like his mother,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled up at him. &ldquo;I want him just like you, dear,&rdquo; she pleaded.

      XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days later the jam of the drive reached the dam at Redding. Orde
      took Carroll downtown in the buckboard. There a seat by the dam-watcher's
      little house was given her, back of the brick factory buildings next the
      power canal, whence for hours she watched the slow onward movement of the
      sullen brown timbers, the smooth, polished-steel rush of the waters
      through the chute, the graceful certain movements of the rivermen. Some of
      the latter were brought up by Orde and introduced. They were very awkward,
      and somewhat embarrassed, but they all looked her straight in the eye, and
      Carroll felt somehow that back of their diffidence they were quite
      dispassionately appraising her. After a few gracious speeches on her part
      and monosyllabic responses on theirs, they blundered away. In spite of the
      scant communication, these interviews left something of a friendly feeling
      on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your Jim Denning,&rdquo; she told Orde; &ldquo;he's a nice, clean-cut fellow.
      And Mr. Bourke,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Isn't he funny with his fierce red beard
      and his little eyes? But he simply adores you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde laughed at the idea of the Rough Red's adoring anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's so,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;and I like him for it&mdash;only I wish he were
      a little cleaner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought the feats of &ldquo;log-riding&rdquo; little less than wonderful, and you
      may be sure the knowledge of her presence did not discourage spectacular
      display. Finally, Johnny Challan, uttering a loud whoop, leaped aboard a
      log and went through the chute standing bolt upright. By a marvel of
      agility, he kept his balance through the white-water below, and emerged
      finally into the lower waters still proudly upright, and dry above the
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll had arisen, the better to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she cried aloud, &ldquo;it's marvellous! Circus riding is nothing to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; replied a gigantic riverman who was working near at hand,
      &ldquo;that ain't nothin'. Ordinary, however, we travel that way on the river.
      At night we have the cookee pass us out each a goose-ha'r piller, and lay
      down for the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carroll looked at him in reproof. He grinned slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't git worried about me, ma'am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I'm hopeless. For twenty
      year now I been wearin' crape on my hat in memory of my departed virtues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the rear had dropped down river from Redding, Carroll and Orde
      returned to their deserted little box of a house at Monrovia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde breathed deep of a new satisfaction in walking again the streets of
      this little sandy, sawdust-paved, shantyfied town, with its yellow hills
      and its wide blue river and its glimpse of the lake far in the offing. It
      had never meant anything to him before. Now he enjoyed every brick and
      board of it; he trod the broken, aromatic shingles of the roadway with
      pleasure; he tramped up the broad stairs and down the dark hall of the
      block with anticipation; he breathed the compounded office odour of
      ledgers, cocoa matting, and old cigar smoke in a long, reminiscent whiff;
      he took his seat at his roll-top desk, enchanted to be again in these
      homely though familiar surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hanged if I know what's struck me,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Never experienced any
      remarkable joy before in getting back to this sort of truck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a warm glow at the heart, the realisation was brought to him.
      This was home, and over yonder, under the shadow of the heaven-pointing
      spire, a slip of a girl was waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to tell her this when next he saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt that I ought to make you a little shrine, and burn candles to you,
      the way the Catholics do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Mater Dolorosa?&rdquo; she mocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her dark eyes so full of the sweetness of content, at her
      sensitive lips with the quaintly upturned corners, and he thought of what
      her home life had been and of the real sorrow that even yet must smoulder
      somewhere down in the deeps of her being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he slowly, &ldquo;not that. I think my shrine will be dedicated to
      Our Lady of the Joyous Soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the week Orde was absent up the river, superintending in a
      general way the latter progress of the drive, looking into the needs of
      the crews, arranging for supplies. The mills were all working now, busily
      cutting into the residue of last season's logs. Soon they would need more.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the booms everything was in readiness to receive the jam. The long
      swing arm slanting across the river channel was attached to its winch
      which would operate it. When shut it would close the main channel and
      shunt into the booms the logs floating in the river. There, penned at last
      by the piles driven in a row and held together at the top by bolted
      timbers, they would lie quiet. Men armed with pike-poles would then take
      up the work of distribution according to the brands stamped on the ends.
      Each brand had its own separate &ldquo;sorting pens,&rdquo; the lower end leading
      again into the open river. From these each owner's property was rafted and
      towed to his private booms at his mill below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde spent the day before the jam appeared in constructing what he called
      a &ldquo;boomerang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invention of my own,&rdquo; he explained to Newmark. &ldquo;Secret invention just
      yet. I'm going to hold up the drive in the main river until we have things
      bunched, then I'm going to throw a big crew down here by the swing.
      Heinzman anticipates, of course, that I'll run the entire drive into the
      booms and do all my sorting there. Naturally, if I turn his logs loose
      into the river as fast as I run across them, he will be able to pick them
      up one at a time, for he'll only get them occasionally. If I keep them
      until everything else is sorted, only Heinzman's logs will remain; and as
      we have no right to hold logs, we'll have to turn them loose through the
      lower sorting booms, where he can be ready to raft them. In that way he
      gets them all right without paying us a cent. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; said Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Orde, with a laugh, &ldquo;here is where I fool him. I'm going to
      rush the drive into the booms all at once, but I'm going to sort out
      Heinzman's logs at these openings near the entrance and turn them into the
      main channel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good will that do?&rdquo; asked Newmark sceptically. &ldquo;He gets them sorted
      just the same, doesn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The current's fairly strong,&rdquo; Orde pointed out, &ldquo;and the river's almighty
      wide. When you spring seven or eight million feet on a man, all at once
      and unexpected, and he with no crew to handle them, he's going to keep
      almighty busy. And if he don't stop them this side his mill, he'll have to
      raft and tow them back; and if he don't stop 'em this side the lake, he
      may as well kiss them all good bye&mdash;except those that drift into the
      bayous and inlets and marshes, and other ungodly places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Newmark drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't say a word anywhere,&rdquo; warned Orde. &ldquo;Secrecy is the watchword of
      success with this merry little joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boomerang worked like a charm. The men had been grumbling at an
      apparently peaceful yielding of the point at issue, and would have sacked
      out many of the blazed logs if Orde had not held them rigidly to it. Now
      their spirits flamed into joy again. The sorting went like clockwork.
      Orde, in personal charge, watched that through the different openings in
      his &ldquo;boomerang&rdquo; the &ldquo;H&rdquo; logs were shunted into the river. Shortly the
      channel was full of logs floating merrily away down the little blue
      wavelets. After a while Orde handed over his job to Tom North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't stand it any longer, boys,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I've got to go down and see
      how the Dutchman is making it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back and tell us!&rdquo; yelled one of the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I will!&rdquo; Orde shouted back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove the team and buckboard down the marsh road to Heinzman's mill.
      There he found evidences of the wildest excitement. The mill had been
      closed down, and all the men turned in to rescue logs. Boats plied in all
      directions. A tug darted back and forth. Constantly the number of floating
      logs augmented, however. Many had already gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think you're busy now,&rdquo; said Orde to himself with a chuckle, &ldquo;just
      wait until you begin to get LOGS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched for a few moments in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he doing with that tug?&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;O-ho! He's stringing booms
      across the river to hold the whole outfit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed aloud, turned his team about, and drove frantically back to the
      booms. Every few moments he chuckled. His eyes danced. Hardly could he
      wait to get there. Once at the camp, he leaped from the buckboard, with a
      shout to the stableman, and ran rapidly out over the booms to where the
      sorting of &ldquo;H&rdquo; logs was going merrily forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's shut down his mill,&rdquo; shouted Orde, &ldquo;and he's got all that gang of
      highbankers out, and every old rum-blossom in Monrovia, and I bet if you
      say 'logs' to him, he'd chase his tail in circles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want this job?&rdquo; North asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Orde, suddenly fallen solemn, &ldquo;haven't time. I'm going to take
      Marsh and the SPRITE and go to town. Old Heinzman,&rdquo; he added as an
      afterthought, &ldquo;is stringing booms across the river&mdash;obstructing
      navigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran down the length of the whole boom to where lay the two tugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marsh,&rdquo; he called when still some distance away, &ldquo;got up steam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There appeared a short, square, blue-clad man, with hard brown cheeks, a
      heavy bleached flaxen moustache, and eyes steady, unwavering, and as blue
      as the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up in two minutes,&rdquo; he answered, and descended from the pilot house to
      shout down a low door leading from the deck into the engine room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harvey,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;fire her up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall, good-natured negro reached the upper half of his body from the low
      door to seize an armful of the slabs piled along the narrow deck. Ten
      minutes later the SPRITE, a cloud of white smoke pouring from her funnel,
      was careening down the stretch of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Marsh guided his energetic charge among the logs floating in the
      stream with the marvellous second instinct of the expert tugboat man. A
      whirl of the wheel to the right, a turn to the left&mdash;the craft heeled
      strongly under the forcing of her powerful rudder to avoid by an
      arm's-length some timbers fairly flung aside by the wash. The displacement
      of the rapid running seemed almost to press the water above the level of
      the deck on either side and about ten feet from the gunwale. As the low
      marshes and cat-tails flew past, Orde noted with satisfaction that many of
      the logs, urged one side by the breeze, had found lodgment among the reeds
      and in the bayous and inlets. One at a time, and painfully, these would
      have to be salvaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time the mills' tall smokestacks loomed in sight. The logs
      thickened until it was with difficulty that Captain Marsh could thread his
      way among them at all. Shortly Orde, standing by the wheel in the
      pilot-house, could see down the stretches of the river a crowd of men
      working antlike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've got 'em stopped,&rdquo; commented Orde. &ldquo;Look at that gang working from
      boats! They haven't a dozen 'cork boots' among 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; asked Captain Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a navigable river, isn't it?&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;Run through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marsh rang for half-speed and began to nose his way gently through the
      loosely floating logs. Soon the tug had reached the scene of activity, and
      headed straight for the slender line of booms hitched end to end and
      stretching quite across the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid we'll just ride over them if we hit them too slow,&rdquo; suggested
      Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be late for the mail unless we hurry,&rdquo; said he. Marsh whirled the
      spokes of his wheel over and rang the engine-room bell. The water churned
      white behind, the tug careened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vat you do! Stop!&rdquo; cried Heinzman from one of the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde stuck his head from the pilot-house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're obstructing navigation!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;I've got to go to town to buy
      a postage-stamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prow of the tug, accurately aimed by Marsh, hit square in the junction
      of two of the booms. Immediately the water was agitated on both sides and
      for a hundred feet or so by the pressure of the long poles sidewise. There
      ensued a moment of strain; then the links snapped, and the SPRITE plunged
      joyously through the opening. The booms, swept aside by the current,
      floated to either shore. The river was open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde, his head still out the door, looked back. &ldquo;Slow down, Marsh,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;Let's see the show.&rdquo; Already the logs caught by the booms had taken
      their motion and had swept past the opening. Although the lonesome tug
      Heinzman had on the work immediately picked up one end of the broken boom,
      and with it started out into the river, she found difficulty in making
      headway against the sweep of the logs. After a long struggle she reached
      the middle of the river, where she was able to hold her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder what next?&rdquo; speculated Orde. &ldquo;How are they going to get the other
      end of the booms out from the other bank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Marsh had reversed the SPRITE. The tug lay nearly motionless
      amidstream, her propeller slowly revolving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up river all the small boats gathered in a line, connected one to the
      other by a rope. The tug passed over to them the cable attached to the
      boom. Evidently the combined efforts of the rowboats were counted on to
      hold the half-boom across the current while the tug brought out the other
      half. When the tug dropped the cable, Orde laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody but a Dutchman would have thought of that!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Now for the
      fun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the weight fell on the small boats, they were dragged
      irresistibly backward. Even from a distance the three men on the SPRITE
      could make out the white-water as the oars splashed and churned and
      frantically caught crabs in a vain effort to hold their own. Marsh lowered
      his telescope, the tears streaming down his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's better than a goat fight,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Futilely protesting, the rowboats were dragged backward, turned as a whip
      is snapped, and strung out along the bank below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll have to have two tugs before they can close the break that way,&rdquo;
       commented Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; replied Captain Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment a black smoke rolled up over the marshes, and shortly
      around the bend from above came the LUCY BELLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LUCY BELLE was the main excuse for calling the river navigable. She
      made trips as often as she could between Redding and Monrovia. In luck,
      she could cover the forty miles in a day. It was no unusual thing,
      however, for the LUCY BELLE to hang up indefinitely on some one of the
      numerous shifting sand bars. For that reason she carried more imperishable
      freight than passengers. In appearance she was two-storied, with twin
      smokestacks, an iron Indian on her top, and a &ldquo;splutter-behind&rdquo;
       paddle-wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There comes his help,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;Old Simpson would stop to pick up a
      bogus three-cent piece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, on hail from one of the rowboats, the LUCY BELLE slowed down
      and stopped. After a short conference, she steamed clumsily over to get
      hold of one end of the booms. The tug took the other. In time, and by dint
      of much splashing, some collisions, and several attempts, the ends of the
      booms were united.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, however, nearly all the logs had escaped. The tug, towing a
      string of rowboats, set out in pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SPRITE continued on her way until beyond sight. Then she slowed down
      again. The LUCY BELLE churned around the bend, and turned in toward the
      tug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's going to speak us,&rdquo; marvelled Orde. &ldquo;I wonder what the dickens she
      wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tug ahoy!&rdquo; bellowed a red-faced individual from the upper deck. He was
      dressed in blue and brass buttons, carried a telescope in one hand, and
      was liberally festooned with gold braid and embroidered anchors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer him,&rdquo; Orde commanded Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo there, commodore! what is it?&rdquo; replied the tug captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-faced figure glared down for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want a tug up there at Heinzman's. Can you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; cried Marsh, choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LUCY BELLE sheered off magnificently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; Marsh asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The commodore always acts as if that old raft was a sixty-gun frigate,&rdquo;
       was Orde's non-committal answer. &ldquo;Head up stream again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman saw the SPRITE coming, and rowed out frantically, splashing at
      every stroke and yelling with every breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you go through there! Vait a minute! Stop, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up!&rdquo; said Orde to Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman rowed alongside, dropped his oars and mopped his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vat you do?&rdquo; he demanded heatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot the money to buy my stamp with,&rdquo; said Orde sweetly. &ldquo;I'm going
      back to get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not through my pooms!&rdquo; cried Heinzman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Heinzman,&rdquo; said Orde severely, &ldquo;you are obstructing a navigable
      stream. I am doing business, and I cannot be interfered with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my logs!&rdquo; cried the unhappy mill man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to do with your logs. You are driving your own logs,&rdquo; Orde
      reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman vituperated and pounded the gunwale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead, Marsh!&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tug gathered way. Soon Heinzman was forced to let go. For a second
      time the chains were snapped. Orde and Marsh looked back over the churning
      wake left by the SPRITE. The severed ends of the booms were swinging back
      toward either shore. Between them floated a rowboat. In the rowboat
      gesticulated a pudgy man. The river was well sprinkled with logs.
      Evidently the sorting was going on well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May as well go back to the works,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;He won't string them
      together again to-day&mdash;not if he waits for that tug he sent Simpson
      for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, they returned to the booms, where work was suspended while
      Orde detailed to an appreciative audience the happenings below. This
      tickled the men immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we hain't sorted out more'n a million feet of his logs,&rdquo; cried
      Rollway Charlie. &ldquo;He hain't SEEN no logs yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned with new enthusiasm to the work of shunting &ldquo;H&rdquo; logs into the
      channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes, however, the stableman picked his way out over the booms
      with a message for Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Heinzman's ashore, and wants to see you,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde and Jim Denning exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Coon's come down,&rdquo; said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde found the mill man pacing restlessly up and down before a steaming
      pair of horses. Newmark, perched on a stump, was surveying him
      sardonically and chewing the end of an unlighted cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you poth are!&rdquo; burst out Heinzman, when Orde stepped ashore. &ldquo;Now,
      this must stop. I must not lose my logs! Vat is your probosition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark broke in quickly before Orde could speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've told Mr. Heinzman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that we would sort and deliver the
      rest of his logs for two dollars a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be about it,&rdquo; agreed Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; exploded Heinzman, &ldquo;that is as much as you agreet to drive and
      deliffer my whole cut!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put I haf all the eggspence of driving the logs myself. Why shoult I pay
      you for doing what I haf alretty paid to haf done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heinzman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I told you I'd make you scratch gravel. Now it's
      time to talk business. You thought you were boring with a mighty auger,
      but it's time to revise. We aren't forced to bother with your logs, and
      you're lucky to get out so easy. If I turn your whole drive into the
      river, you'll lose more than half of it outright, and it'll cost you a
      heap to salvage the rest. And what's more, I'll turn 'em in before you can
      get hold of a pile-driver. I'll sort night and day,&rdquo; he bluffed, &ldquo;and by
      to-morrow morning you won't have a stick of timber above my booms.&rdquo; He
      laughed again. &ldquo;You want to get down to business almighty sudden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When finally Heinzman had driven sadly away, and the whole drive, &ldquo;H&rdquo; logs
      included, was pouring into the main boom, Orde stretched his arms over his
      head in a luxury of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That just about settles that campaign,&rdquo; he said to Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, it doesn't,&rdquo; replied the latter decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Orde, surprised. &ldquo;You don't imagine he'll do anything more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I will,&rdquo; said Newmark.

    <h2>
      XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early in the fall the baby was born. It proved to be a boy. Orde, nervous
      as a cat after the ordeal of doing nothing, tiptoed into the darkened
      room. He found his wife weak and pale, her dark hair framing her face, a
      new look of rapt inner contemplation rendering even more mysterious her
      always fathomless eyes. To Orde she seemed fragile, aloof, enshrined among
      her laces and dainty ribbons. Hardly dared he touch her when she held her
      hand out to him weakly, but fell on his knees beside the bed and buried
      his face in the clothes. She placed a gentle hand caressingly on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they remained for some time. Finally he raised his eyes. She held her
      lips to him. He kissed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems sort of make-believe even yet, sweetheart,&rdquo; she smiled at him
      whimsically, &ldquo;that we have a real, live baby all of our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like other people,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not like other people at all!&rdquo; she disclaimed, with a show of
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Orde brought the newcomer in for Orde's inspection. He looked
      gravely down on the puckered, discoloured bit of humanity with some
      feeling of disappointment, and perhaps a faint uneasiness. After a moment
      he voiced the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;do you think&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;does the
      doctor say he's going to be all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; cried Grandma Orde indignantly. &ldquo;I'd like to know if he isn't
      all right now! What in the world do you expect of a new-born baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Carroll was laughing softly to herself on the bed. She held out her
      arms for the baby, and cuddled it close to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a little darling,&rdquo; she crooned, &ldquo;and he's going to grow up big and
      strong, just like his daddy.&rdquo; She put her cheek against the sleeping
      babe's and looked up sidewise at the two standing above her. &ldquo;But I know
      how you feel,&rdquo; she said to her husband. &ldquo;When they first showed him to me,
      I thought he looked like a peanut a thousand years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Orde fairly snorted with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to your old grandmother, who appreciates you!&rdquo; she cried, possessing
      herself of the infant. &ldquo;He's a beautiful baby; one of the best-looking
      new-born babies I ever saw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde escaped to the open air. He had to go to the office to attend to some
      details of the business. With every step his elation increased. At the
      office he threw open his desk with a slam. Newmark jumped nervously and
      frowned. Orde's big, open, and brusque manners bothered him as they would
      have bothered a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a son and heir over at my place,&rdquo; called Orde in his big voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This old firm's got to rustle now, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Congratulate you, I'm sure,&rdquo; said Newmark rather shortly. &ldquo;Mrs. Orde is
      doing well, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine, fine!&rdquo; cried Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark dropped the subject and plunged into a business matter. Orde's
      attention, however, was flighty. After a little while he closed his desk
      with another bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Got to make it a vacation. I'm going to run over to
      see how the family is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, the young couple had not discussed before the question
      of a name. One evening at twilight, when Orde was perched at the foot of
      the bed, Carroll brought up the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to be named for you,&rdquo; she began timidly. &ldquo;I know that, Jack, and
      I'd love to have another Jack Orde in the family; but, dear, I've been
      thinking about father. He's a poor, forlorn old man, who doesn't get much
      out of life. And it would please him so&mdash;oh, more than you can
      imagine such a thing could please anybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him doubtfully. Orde said nothing, but walked around the
      bed to where the baby lay in his little cradle. He leaned over and took
      the infant up in his gingerly awkward fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you to-day, Bobby Orde?&rdquo; he inquired of the blinking mite.

    <h2>
      XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first season of the Boom Company was most successful. Its prospects
      for the future were bright. The drive had been delivered to its various
      owners at a price below what it had cost them severally, and without the
      necessary attendant bother. Therefore, the loggers were only too willing
      to renew their contracts for another year. This did not satisfy Newmark,
      however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we want,&rdquo; he told Orde, &ldquo;is a charter giving us exclusive rights on
      the river, and authorising us to ask toll. I'm going to try and get one
      out of the legislature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He departed for Lansing as soon as the Assembly opened, and almost
      immediately became lost in one of those fierce struggles of politics not
      less bitter because concealed. Heinzman was already on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark had the shadow of right on his side, for he applied for the
      charter on the basis of the river improvements already put in by his firm.
      Heinzman, however, possessed much political influence, a deep knowledge of
      the subterranean workings of plot and counterplot, and a &ldquo;barrel.&rdquo;
       Although armed with an apparently incontestable legal right, Newmark soon
      found himself fighting on the defensive. Heinzman wanted the improvements
      already existing condemned and sold as a public utility to the highest
      bidder. He offered further guarantees as to future improvements. In
      addition were other and more potent arguments proffered behind closed
      doors. Many cases resolved themselves into a bald question of cash. Others
      demanded diplomacy. Jobs, fat contracts, business favours, influence were
      all flung out freely&mdash;bribes as absolute as though stamped with the
      dollar mark. Newspapers all over the State were pressed into service.
      These, bought up by Heinzman and his prospective partners in a lucrative
      business, spoke virtuously of private piracy of what are now called public
      utilities, the exploiting of the people's natural wealths, and all the
      rest of a specious reasoning the more convincing in that it was in many
      other cases only too true. The independent journals, uninformed of the
      rights of the case, either remained silent on the matter, or groped in a
      puzzled and undecided manner on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against this secret but effective organisation Newmark most unexpectedly
      found himself pitted. He had anticipated being absent but a week; he
      became involved in an affair of months.
    </p>
    <p>
      With decision he applied himself to the problem. He took rooms at the
      hotel, sent for Orde, and began at once to set in motion the machinery of
      opposition. The refreshed resources of the company were strained to the
      breaking point in order to raise money for this new campaign opening
      before it. Orde, returning to Lansing after a trip devoted to the carrying
      out of Newmark's directions as to finances, was dismayed at the tangle of
      strategy and cross-strategy, innuendo, vague and formless cobweb forces by
      which he was surrounded. He could make nothing of them. They brushed his
      face, he felt their influence, yet he could place his finger on no
      tangible and comprehensible solidity. Among these delicate and complicated
      cross-currents Newmark moved silent, cold, secret. He seemed to understand
      them, to play with them, to manipulate them as elements of the game. Above
      them was the hollow shock of the ostensible battle&mdash;the speeches, the
      loud talk in lobbies, the newspaper virtue, indignation, accusations; but
      the real struggle was here in the furtive ways, in whispered words
      delivered hastily aside, in hotel halls on the way to and from the stairs,
      behind closed doors of rooms without open transoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde in comic despair acknowledged that it was all &ldquo;too deep for him.&rdquo;
       Nevertheless, it was soon borne in on him that the new company was
      struggling for its very right to existence. It had been doing that from
      the first; but now, to Orde the fight, the existence, had a new
      importance. The company up to this point had been a scheme merely, an
      experiment that might win or lose. Now, with the history of a drive behind
      it, it had become a living entity. Orde would have fought against its
      dissolution as he would have fought against a murder. Yet he had
      practically to stand one side, watching Newmark's slender, gray-clad,
      tense figure gliding here and there, more silent, more reserved, more
      watchful every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fight endured through most of the first half of the session. When
      finally it became evident to Heinzman that Newmark would win, he made the
      issue of toll rates the ditch of his last resistance, trying to force
      legal charges so low as to eat up the profits. At the last, however, the
      bill passed the board. The company had its charter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At what price only Newmark could have told. He had fought with the tense
      earnestness of the nervous temperament that fights to win without count of
      the cost. The firm was established, but it was as heavily in debt as its
      credit would stand. Newmark himself, though as calm and reserved and
      precise as ever, seemed to have turned gray, and one of his eyelids had
      acquired a slight nervous twitch which persisted for some months. He took
      his seat at the desk, however, as calmly as ever. In three days the
      scandalised howls of bribery and corruption had given place in the
      newspapers to some other sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Orde to his partner, &ldquo;how about all this talk? Is there really
      anything in it? You haven't gone in for that business, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark stretched his arms wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Press bought up,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I know for a fact that old Stanford got
      five hundred dollars from some of the Heinzman interests. I could have
      swung him back for an extra hundred, but it wasn't worth while. They howl
      bribery at us to distract attention from their own performances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this evasive reply Orde contented himself. Whether it satisfied him
      or whether he was loath to pursue the subject further it would be
      impossible to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's cost us plenty, anyway,&rdquo; he said, after a moment. &ldquo;The proposition's
      got a load on it. It will take us a long time to get out of debt. The
      river driving won't pay quite so big as we thought it would,&rdquo; he
      concluded, with a rueful little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will pay plenty well enough,&rdquo; replied Newmark decidedly, &ldquo;and it gives
      us a vantage point to work from. You don't suppose we are going to quit at
      river driving, do you? We want to look around for some timber of our own;
      there's where the big money is. And perhaps we can buy a schooner or two
      and go into the carrying trade&mdash;the country's alive with opportunity.
      Newmark and Orde means something to these fellows now. We can have
      anything we want, if we just reach out for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His thin figure, ordinarily slightly askew, had straightened; his
      steel-gray, impersonal eyes had lit up behind the bowed glasses and were
      seeing things beyond the wall at which they gazed. Orde looked up at him
      with a sudden admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're the brains of this concern,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll get on,&rdquo; replied Newmark, the fire dying from his eyes.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the course of the next eight years Newmark and Orde floated high on
      that flood of apparent prosperity that attends a business well conceived
      and passably well managed. The Boom and Driving Company made money, of
      course, for with the margin of fifty per cent or thereabouts necessitated
      by the temporary value of the improvements, good years could hardly fail
      to bring good returns. This, it will be remembered, was a stock company.
      With the profits from that business the two men embarked on a separate
      copartnership. They made money at this, too, but the burden of debt
      necessitated by new ventures, constantly weighted by the heavy interest
      demanded at that time, kept affairs on the ragged edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, both Orde and Newmark were more inclined to extension of
      interests than to &ldquo;playing safe.&rdquo; The assets gained in one venture were
      promptly pledged to another. The ramifications of debt, property,
      mortgages, and expectations overlapped each other in a cobweb of
      interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde lived at ease in a new house of some size surrounded by grounds. He
      kept two servants: a blooded team of horses drew the successor to the
      original buckboard. Newmark owned a sail yacht of five or six tons, in
      which, quite solitary, he took his only pleasure. Both were considered men
      of substance and property, as indeed they were. Only, they risked dollars
      to gain thousands. A succession of bad years, a panic-contraction of money
      markets, any one of a dozen possible, though not probable, contingencies
      would render it difficult to meet the obligations which constantly came
      due, and which Newmark kept busy devising ways and means of meeting. If
      things went well&mdash;and it may be remarked that legitimately they
      should&mdash;Newmark and Orde would some day be rated among the
      millionaire firms. If things went ill, bankruptcy could not be avoided.
      There was no middle ground. Nor were Orde and his partner unique in this;
      practically every firm then developing or exploiting the natural resources
      of the country found itself in the same case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after the granting of the charter to drive the river the
      partners had offered them an opportunity of acquiring about thirty million
      feet of timber remaining from Morrison and Daly's original holdings. That
      firm was very anxious to begin development on a large scale of its Beeson
      Lake properties in the Saginaw waters. Daly proposed to Orde that he take
      over the remnant, and having confidence in the young man's abilities,
      agreed to let him have it on long-time notes. After several consultations
      with Newmark, Orde finally completed the purchase. Below the booms they
      erected a mill, the machinery for which they had also bought of Daly, at
      Redding. The following winter Orde spent in the woods. By spring he had
      banked, ready to drive, about six million feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some years these two sorts of activity gave the partners about all
      they could attend to. As soon as the drive had passed Redding, Orde left
      it in charge of one of his foremen while he divided his time between the
      booms and the mill. Late in the year his woods trips began, the tours of
      inspection, of surveying for new roads, the inevitable preparation for the
      long winter campaigns in the forest. As soon as the spring thaws began,
      once more the drive demanded his attention. And in marketing the lumber,
      manipulating the firm's financial affairs, collecting its dues, paying its
      bills, making its purchases, and keeping oiled the intricate bearing
      points of its office machinery, Newmark was busy&mdash;and invaluable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the fifth year the opportunity came, through a combination
      of a bad debt and a man's death, to get possession of two lake schooners.
      Orde at once suggested the contract for a steam barge. Towing was then in
      its infancy. The bulk of lake traffic was by means of individual sailing
      ships&mdash;a method uncertain as to time. Orde thought that a steam barge
      could be built powerful enough not only to carry its own hold and deck
      loads, but to tow after it the two schooners. In this manner the crews
      could be reduced, and an approximate date of delivery could be guaranteed.
      Newmark agreed with him. Thus the firm, in accordance with his prophecy,
      went into the carrying trade, for the vessels more than sufficed for its
      own needs. The freighting of lumber added much to the income, and the
      carrying of machinery and other heavy freight on the return trip grew
      every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by far the most important acquisition was that of the northern
      peninsula timber. Most operators called the white pine along and back from
      the river inexhaustible. Orde did not believe this. He saw the time, not
      far distant, when the world would be compelled to look elsewhere for its
      lumber supply, and he turned his eyes to the almost unknown North. After a
      long investigation through agents, and a month's land-looking on his own
      account, he located and purchased three hundred million feet. This was to
      be paid for, as usual, mostly by the firm's notes secured by its other
      property. It would become available only in the future, but Orde believed,
      as indeed the event justified, this future would prove to be not so
      distant as most people supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these interests widened, Orde became more and more immersed in them. He
      was forced to be away all of every day, and more than the bulk of every
      year. Nevertheless, his home life did not suffer for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Carroll he was always the same big, hearty, whole-souled boy she had
      first learned to love. She had all his confidence. If this did not extend
      into business affairs, it was because Orde had always tried to get away
      from them when at home. At first Carroll had attempted to keep in the
      current of her husband's activities, but as the latter broadened in scope
      and became more complex, she perceived that their explanation wearied him.
      She grew out of the habit of asking him about them. Soon their rapid
      advance had carried them quite beyond her horizon. To her, also, as to
      most women, the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; connoted nothing but a turmoil and a
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all other things they were to each other what they had been from the
      first. No more children had come to them. Bobby, however; had turned out a
      sturdy, honest little fellow, with more than a streak of his mother's
      charm and intuition. His future was the subject of all Orde's plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to give him all the chance there is,&rdquo; he explained to Carroll. &ldquo;A
      boy ought to start where his father left off, and not have to do the same
      thing all over again. But being a rich man's son isn't much of a job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you let him continue your business?&rdquo; smiled Carroll, secretly
      amused at the idea of the small person before them ever doing anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the time Bobby's grown up this business will all be closed out,&rdquo;
       replied Orde seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to look at his minute son with puckered brow, until Carroll
      smoothed out the wrinkles with the tips of her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, having only a few minutes to decide,&rdquo; she mocked, &ldquo;perhaps
      we'd better make up our minds right now to have him a street-car driver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; agreed Bobby unexpectedly, and with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years after this conversation, which would have made Bobby just
      eight, Orde came back before six of a summer evening, his face alight with
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, bub!&rdquo; he cried to Bobby, tossing him to his shoulder. &ldquo;How's the
      kid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went out together, while awaiting dinner, to see the new setter puppy
      in the woodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Named him yet?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duke,&rdquo; said Bobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde surveyed the animal gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems like a good name,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner the two adjourned to the library, where they sat together in
      the &ldquo;big chair,&rdquo; and Bobby, squirmed a little sidewise in order the better
      to see, watched the smoke from his father's cigar as it eddied and curled
      in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell a story,&rdquo; he commanded finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; acquiesced Orde, &ldquo;there was once a man who had a cow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once upon a time,&rdquo; corrected Bobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened for a moment or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like that story,&rdquo; he then announced. &ldquo;Tell the story about the
      bears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is a new story,&rdquo; protested Orde, &ldquo;and you've heard about the
      bears so many times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bears,&rdquo; insisted Bobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, once upon a time there were three bears&mdash;a big bear and a
      middle-sized bear and a little bear&mdash;&rdquo; began Orde obediently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobby, with a sigh of rapture and content, curled up in a snug, warm
      little ball. The twilight darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blind-man's holiday!&rdquo; warned Carroll behind them so suddenly that they
      both jumped. &ldquo;And the sand man's been at somebody, I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bore him away to bed. Orde sat smoking in the darkness, staring
      straight ahead of him into the future. He believed he had found the
      opportunity&mdash;twenty years distant&mdash;for which he had been looking
      so long.

    <h2>
      XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      After a time Carroll descended the stairs, chuckling. &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she called
      into the sitting-room, &ldquo;come out on the porch. What do you suppose the
      young man did to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; replied Orde promptly. &ldquo;No good guessing when it's a
      question of that youngster's performances. What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said his 'Now I lay me,' and asked blessings on you and me, and the
      grandpas and grandmas, and Auntie Kate, as usual. Then he stopped. 'What
      else?' I reminded him. 'And,' he finished with a rush,
      'make-Bobby-a-good-boy-and-give-him-plenty-of-bread-'n-butter-'n
      apple-sauce!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed delightedly over this, clinging together like two children.
      Then they stepped out on the little porch and looked into the fathomless
      night. The sky was full of stars, aloof and calm, but waiting breathless
      on the edge of action, attending the word of command or the celestial
      vision, or whatever it is for which stars seem to wait. Along the street
      the dense velvet shade of the maples threw the sidewalks into impenetrable
      blackness. Sounds carried clearly. From the Welton's, down the street,
      came the tinkle of a mandolin and an occasional low laugh from the group
      of young people that nightly frequented the front steps. Tree toads
      chirped in unison or fell abruptly silent as though by signal. All up and
      down the rows of houses whirred the low monotone of the lawn sprinklers,
      and the aroma of their wetness was borne cool and refreshing through the
      tepid air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde and his wife sat together on the top step. He slipped his arm about
      her. They said nothing, but breathed deep of the quiet happiness that
      filled their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate latch clicked and two shadowy figures defined themselves
      approaching up the concrete walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; called Orde cheerfully into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; a man's voice instantly responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taylor and Clara,&rdquo; said Orde to Carroll with satisfaction. &ldquo;Just the man
      I wanted to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer and his wife mounted the steps. He was a quick, energetic,
      spare man, with lean cheeks, a bristling, clipped moustache, and a slight
      stoop to his shoulders. She was small, piquant, almost child-like, with a
      dainty up-turned nose, a large and lustrous eye, a constant, bird-like
      animation of manner&mdash;the Folly of artists, the adorable, lovable,
      harmless Folly standing tiptoe on a complaisant world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the man I wanted to see,&rdquo; repeated Orde, as the two approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara Taylor stopped short and considered him for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us away,&rdquo; she said seriously to Carroll. &ldquo;My prophetic soul tells me
      they are going to talk business, and if any more business is talked in my
      presence, I shall EXPIRE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both men laughed, but Orde explained apologetically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know, Mrs. Taylor, these are my especially busy days for the
      firm, and I have to work my private affairs in when I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Frank was very solicitous about my getting out in the air,&rdquo;
       cried Clara. &ldquo;Come, Carroll, let's wander down the street and see Mina
      Heinzman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two interlocked arms and sauntered along the walk. Both men lit cigars
      and sat on the top step of the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Taylor,&rdquo; broke in Orde abruptly, &ldquo;you told me the other day
      you had fifteen or twenty thousand you wanted to place somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I believe I have just the proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;California pine,&rdquo; replied Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;California pine?&rdquo; repeated Taylor, after a slight pause. &ldquo;Why California?
      That's a long way off. And there's no market, is there? Why way out
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's cheap,&rdquo; replied Orde succinctly. &ldquo;I don't say it will be good for
      immediate returns, nor even for returns in the near future, but in twenty
      or thirty years it ought to pay big on a small investment made now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taylor shook his head doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how you figure it,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;We have more timber than we
      can use in the East. Why should we go several thousand miles west for the
      same thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When our timber gives out, then we'll HAVE to go west,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taylor laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh all you please,&rdquo; rejoined Orde, &ldquo;but I tell you Michigan and
      Wisconsin pine is doomed. Twenty or thirty years from now there won't be
      any white pine for sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; objected Taylor. &ldquo;You're talking wild. We haven't even begun
      on the upper peninsula. After that there's Minnesota. And I haven't
      observed that we're quite out of timber on the river, or the Muskegon, or
      the Saginaw, or the Grand, or the Cheboygan&mdash;why, Great Scott! man,
      our children's children's children may be thinking of investing in
      California timber, but that's about soon enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All tight,&rdquo; said Orde quietly. &ldquo;Well, what do you think of Indiana as a
      good field for timber investment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indiana!&rdquo; cried Taylor, amazed. &ldquo;Why, there's no timber there; it's a
      prairie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There used to be. And all the southern Michigan farm belt was timbered,
      and around here. We have our stumps to show for it, but there are no
      evidences at all farther south. You'd have hard work, for instance, to
      persuade a stranger that Van Buren County was once forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it?&rdquo; asked Taylor doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was. You take your map and see how much area has been cut already, and
      how much remains. That'll open your eyes. And remember all that has been
      done by crude methods for a relatively small demand. The demand increases
      as the country grows and methods improve. It would not surprise me if some
      day thirty or forty millions would constitute an average cut. [*]
      'Michigan pine exhaustless!'&mdash;those fellows make me sick!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * At the present day some firms cut as high as 150,000,000
     feet.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds a little more reasonable,&rdquo; said Taylor slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll sound a lot more reasonable in five or ten years,&rdquo; insisted Orde,
      &ldquo;and then you'll see the big men rushing out into that Oregon and
      California country. But now a man can get practically the pick of the
      coast. There are only a few big concerns out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it that no one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Orde cut him short, &ldquo;the big things are for the fellow who can
      see far enough ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a proposition have you?&rdquo; asked Taylor after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can get ten thousand acres at an average price of eight dollars an
      acre,&rdquo; replied Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acres? What does that mean in timber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On this particular tract it means about four hundred million feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about twenty cents a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of course you couldn't operate for a long time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for twenty, maybe thirty, years,&rdquo; replied Orde calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's your interest on your money, and taxes, and the risk of fire and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; agreed Orde impatiently, &ldquo;but you're getting your
      stumpage for twenty cents or a little more, and in thirty years it will be
      worth as high as a dollar and a half.&rdquo; [*]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * At the present time (1908) sugar pine such as Orde
     described would cost $3.50 to $4.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my opinion,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taylor relapsed into thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Orde,&rdquo; he broke out finally, &ldquo;how old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-eight. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much timber have you in Michigan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About ten million that we've picked up on the river since the Daly
      purchase and three hundred million in the northern peninsula.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which will take you twenty years to cut, and make you a million dollars
      or so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why this investment thirty years ahead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's for Bobby,&rdquo; explained Orde simply. &ldquo;A man likes to have his son
      continue on in his business. I can't do it here, but there I can. It would
      take fifty years to cut that pine, and that will give Bobby a steady
      income and a steady business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bobby will be well enough off, anyway. He won't have to go into
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde's brow puckered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a man&mdash;Bobby is going to work. A man is not a success in life
      unless he does something, and Bobby is going to be a success. Why,
      Taylor,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;the little rascal fills the wood-box for a cent a
      time, and that's all the pocket-money he gets. He's saving now to buy a
      thousand-dollar boat. I've agreed to pool in half. At his present rate of
      income, I'm safe for about sixty years yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon are you going to close this deal?&rdquo; asked Taylor, rising as he
      caught sight of two figures coming up the walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an option until November 1,&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;If you can't make it,
      I guess I can swing it myself. By the way, keep this dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taylor nodded, and the two turned to defend themselves as best they could
      against Clara's laughing attack.

      XXXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde had said nothing to Newmark concerning this purposed new investment,
      nor did he intend doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for Bobby,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;and I want Bobby, and no one else, to
      run it. Joe would want to take charge, naturally. Taylor won't. He knows
      nothing of the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked downtown next morning busily formulating his scheme. At the
      office he found Newmark already seated at his desk, a pile of letters in
      front of him. Upon Orde's boisterous greeting his nerves crisped slightly,
      but of this there was no outward sign beyond a tightening of his hands on
      the letter he was reading. Behind his eye-glasses his blue, cynical eyes
      twinkled like frost crystals. As always, he was immaculately dressed in
      neat gray clothes, and carried in one corner of his mouth an unlighted
      cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Orde, spinning a chair to Newmark's roll-top desk and speaking
      in a low tone, &ldquo;just how do we stand on that upper peninsula stumpage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? How much of it is there? You know that as well as I do&mdash;about
      three hundred million.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I mean financially.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've made two payments of seventy-five thousand each, and have still two
      to make of the same amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could we borrow on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't want to borrow anything on it,&rdquo; returned Newmark in a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not; but if we should?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might raise fifty or seventy-five thousand, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Orde, &ldquo;I want to raise about seventy-five thousand dollars on
      my share in this concern, if it can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up?&rdquo; inquired Newmark keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a private matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark said nothing, but for some time thought busily, his light blue
      eyes narrowed to a slit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to figure on it a while,&rdquo; said he at last, and turned back to
      his mail. All day he worked hard, with only a fifteen-minute intermission
      for a lunch which was brought up from the hotel below. At six o'clock he
      slammed shut the desk. He descended the stairs with Orde, from whom he
      parted at their foot, and walked precisely away, his tall, thin figure
      held rigid and slightly askew, his pale eyes slitted behind his
      eye-glasses, the unlighted cigar in one corner of his straight lips. To
      the occasional passerby he bowed coldly and with formality. At the corner
      below he bore to the left, and after a short walk entered the small
      one-story house set well back from the sidewalk among the clumps of
      oleanders. Here he turned into a study, quietly and richly furnished ten
      years in advance of the taste then prevalent in Monrovia, where he sank
      into a deep-cushioned chair and lit the much-chewed cigar. For some
      moments he lay back with his eyes shut. Then he opened them to look with
      approval on the dark walnut book-cases, the framed prints and etchings,
      the bronzed student's lamp on the square table desk, the rugs on the
      polished floor. He picked up a magazine, into which he dipped for ten
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened noiselessly behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newmark, sir,&rdquo; came a respectful voice, &ldquo;it is just short of seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Newmark, without looking around.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man withdrew as softly as he had come. After a moment, Newmark
      replaced the magazine on the table, yawned, threw aside the cigar, of
      which he had smoked but an inch, and passed from his study into his
      bedroom across the hall. This contained an exquisite Colonial four-poster,
      with a lowboy and dresser to match, and was papered and carpeted in
      accordance with these, its chief ornaments. Newmark bathed in the
      adjoining bathroom, shaved carefully between the two wax lights which were
      his whim, and dressed in what were then known as &ldquo;swallow-tail&rdquo; clothes.
      Probably he was the only man in Monrovia at that moment so apparelled.
      Then calmly, and with all the deliberation of one under fire of a hundred
      eyes, he proceeded to the dining-room, where waited the man who had a
      short time before reminded him of the hour. He was a solemn, dignified
      man, whose like was not to be found elsewhere this side the city. He, too,
      wore the &ldquo;swallow-tail,&rdquo; but its buttons were of gilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark seated himself in a leather-upholstered mahogany chair before a
      small, round, mahogany table. The room was illuminated only by four wax
      candles with red shades. They threw into relief the polish of mahogany,
      the glitter of glass, the shine of silver, but into darkness the detail of
      massive sideboard, dull panelling, and the two or three dark-toned
      sporting prints on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may serve dinner, Mallock,&rdquo; said Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate deliberately and with enjoyment the meal, exquisitely prepared and
      exquisitely presented to him. With it he drank a single glass of Burgundy&mdash;a
      deed that would, in the eyes of Monrovia, have condemned him as certainly
      as driving a horse on Sunday or playing cards for a stake. Afterward he
      returned to the study, whither Mallock brought coffee. He lit another
      cigar, opened a drawer in his desk, extracted therefrom some bank-books
      and small personal account books. From these he figured all the evening.
      His cigar went out, but he did not notice that, and chewed away quite
      contentedly on the dead butt. When he had finished, his cold eye exhibited
      a gleam of satisfaction. He had resolved on a course of action. At ten
      o'clock he went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Mallock closed the door behind him promptly upon the stroke
      of eight. It was strange that not one living soul but Mallock had ever
      entered Newmark's abode. Curiosity had at first brought a few callers; but
      these were always met by the imperturbable servant with so plausible a
      reason for his master's absence that the visitors had departed without a
      suspicion that they had been deliberately excluded. And as Newmark made no
      friends and excited little interest, the attempts to cultivate him
      gradually ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orde,&rdquo; said Newmark, as the former entered the office, &ldquo;I think I can
      arrange this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde drew up a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I talked last evening with a man from Detroit named Thayer, who thinks he
      may advance seventy-five thousand dollars on a mortgage on our northern
      peninsula stumpage. For that, of course, we will give the firm's note with
      interest at ten per cent. I will turn this over to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's&mdash;&rdquo; began Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; interrupted Newmark. &ldquo;As collateral security you will deposit
      for me your stock in the Boom Company, indorsed in blank. If you do not
      pay the full amount of the firm's note to Thayer, then the stock will be
      turned in to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don't misunderstand me,&rdquo; said Newmark drily. &ldquo;This is your own
      affair, and I do not urge it on you. If we raise as much as seventy-five
      thousand dollars on that upper peninsula stumpage, it will be all it can
      stand, for next year we must make a third payment on it. If you take that
      money, it is of course proper that you pay the interest on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if there's any possibility of the foreclosure of the mortgage, it is
      only right that you run all the risk of loss&mdash;not myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; repeated Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From another point of view,&rdquo; went on Newmark, &ldquo;you are practically
      mortgaging your interest in the Boom Company for seventy-five thousand
      dollars. That would make, on the usual basis of a mortgage, your share
      worth above two hundred thousand&mdash;and four hundred thousand is a high
      valuation of our property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That looks more than decent on your part,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it's none of my business what you intend to do with this,&rdquo;
       went on Newmark, &ldquo;but unless you're SURE you can meet these notes, I
      should strongly advise against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same remark applies to any mortgage,&rdquo; rejoined Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how long a time could I get this?&rdquo; asked Orde at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't promise it for longer than five years,&rdquo; replied Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would make about fifteen thousand a year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;and interest. Well, I don't see why I can't carry that
      easily on our present showing and prospects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If nothing untoward happens,&rdquo; insisted Newmark determined to put forward
      all objections possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not much risk,&rdquo; said Orde hopefully. &ldquo;There's nothing surer than
      lumber. We'll pay the notes easily enough as we cut, and the Boom
      Company's on velvet now. What do our earnings figure, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're driving one hundred and fifty million at a profit of about sixty
      cents a thousand,&rdquo; said Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's ninety thousand dollars&mdash;in five years, four hundred and
      fifty thousand,&rdquo; said Orde, sucking his pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to clean up five dollars a thousand on our mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about a hundred thousand on what we've got left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that little barge business nets us about twelve or fifteen thousand a
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the five years about sixty thousand more. Let's see&mdash;that's a
      total of say six hundred thousand dollars in five years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have to take up in that time,&rdquo; said Newmark, who seemed to have
      the statistics at his finger-tips, &ldquo;the two payments on our timber, the
      note on the First National, the Commercial note, the remaining liabilities
      on the Boom Company&mdash;about three hundred thousand all told, counting
      the interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde crumpled the paper and threw it into the waste basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Good enough. I ought to get along on a margin like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went over to his own desk, where he again set to figuring on his pad.
      The results he eyed a little doubtfully. Each year he must pay in interest
      the sum of seven thousand five hundred dollars. Each year he would have to
      count on a proportionate saving of fifteen thousand dollars toward payment
      of the notes. In addition, he must live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Orde family is going to be mighty hard up,&rdquo; said he, whistling
      humorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Orde was by nature and training sanguine and fond of big risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; it's for Bobby,&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;And maybe the rate of
      interest will go down. And I'll be able to borrow on the California tract
      if anything does go wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put on his hat, thrust a bundle of papers into his pocket, and stepped
      across the hall into Taylor's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer he found tipped back in his revolving chair, reading a printed
      brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; began Orde immediately, &ldquo;I came to see you about that California
      timber matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taylor laid down the brief and removed his eye-glasses, with which he
      began immediately to tap the fingers of his left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Jack,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm glad you came in. I was going to try to
      see you some time to-day. I've been thinking the matter over very
      carefully since the other day, and I've come to the conclusion that it is
      too steep for me. I don't doubt the investment a bit, but the returns are
      too far off. Fifteen thousand means a lot more to me than it does to you,
      and I've got to think of the immediate future. I hope you weren't counting
      on me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; broke in Orde. &ldquo;As I told you, I can swing the
      thing myself, and only mentioned it to you on the off chance you might
      want to invest. Now, what I want is this&mdash;&rdquo; he proceeded to outline
      carefully the agreement between himself and Newmark while the lawyer took
      notes and occasionally interjected a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the latter, when the details had been mastered. &ldquo;I'll
      draw the necessary notes and papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; went on Orde, producing the bundle of papers from his pocket,
      &ldquo;here's the abstract of title. I wish you'd look it over. It's a long one,
      but not complicated, as near as I can make out. Trace seems to have
      acquired this tract mostly from the original homesteaders and the like,
      who, of course, take title direct from the government. But naturally there
      are a heap of them, and I want you to look it over to be sure everything's
      shipshape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Taylor, reaching for the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One other thing,&rdquo; concluded Orde, uncrossing his legs. &ldquo;I want this
      investment to get no further than the office door. You see, this is for
      Bobby, and I've given a lot of thought to that sort of thing; and nothing
      spoils a man sooner than to imagine the thing's all cut and dried for him,
      and nothing keeps him going like the thought that he's got to rustle his
      own opportunities. You and I know that. Bobby's going to have the best
      education possible; he's going to learn to be a lumberman by practical
      experience, and that practical experience he'll get with other people. No
      working for his dad in Bobby's, I can tell you. When he gets through
      college, I'll get him a little job clerking with some good firm, and he'll
      have a chance to show what is in him and to learn the business from the
      ground up, the way a man ought to. Of course, I'll make arrangements that
      he has a real chance. Then, when he's worked into the harness a little,
      the old man will take him out and show him the fine big sugar pine and say
      to him, 'There, my boy, there's your opportunity, and you've earned it.
      How does ORDE AND SON sound to you?' What do you think of it, Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taylor nodded several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you're on the right track, and I'll help you all I can,&rdquo; said
      he briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, of course, I want to keep the thing dead secret,&rdquo; continued Orde.
      &ldquo;You're the only man who knows anything about it. I'm not even going to
      buy directly under my own name. I'm going to incorporate myself,&rdquo; he said,
      with a grin. &ldquo;You know how those things will get out, and how they always
      get back to the wrong people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count on me,&rdquo; Taylor assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Orde walked home that evening, after a hot day, his mind was full of
      speculation as to the immediate future. He had a local reputation for
      wealth, and no one knew better than himself how important it is for a man
      in debt to keep up appearances. Nevertheless, decided retrenchment would
      be necessary. After Bobby had gone to bed, he explained this to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; she asked quickly. &ldquo;Is the firm losing money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Orde, &ldquo;it's a matter of reinvestment.&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;It's a
      dead secret, which I don't want to get out, but I'm thinking of buying
      some western timber for Bobby when he grows up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carroll laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You so relieve my mind,&rdquo; she smiled at him. &ldquo;I was afraid you'd decided
      on the street-car-driver idea. Why, sweetheart, you know perfectly well we
      could go back to the little house next the church and be as happy as
      larks.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p>
      In the meantime Newmark had closed his desk, picked his hat from the nail,
      and marched precisely down the street to Heinzman's office. He found the
      little German in. Newmark demanded a private interview, and without
      preliminary plunged into the business that had brought him. He had long
      since taken Heinzman's measure, as, indeed, he had taken the measure of
      every other man with whom he did or was likely to do business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heinzman,&rdquo; said he abruptly, &ldquo;my partner wants to raise seventy-five
      thousand dollars for his personal use. I have agreed to get him that money
      from the firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman sat immovable, his round eyes blinking behind his big spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; said he shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As security in case he cannot pay the notes the firm will have to give,
      he has signed an agreement to turn over to me his undivided one-half
      interest in our enterprises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell? You vant to borrow dot money of me?&rdquo; asked Heinzman. &ldquo;I could not
      raise it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that perfectly well,&rdquo; replied Newmark coolly. &ldquo;You are going to
      have difficulty meeting your July notes, as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman hardly seemed to breathe, but a flicker of red blazed in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; he repeated non-committally, after a moment. &ldquo;I intend,&rdquo; went
      on Newmark, &ldquo;to furnish this money myself. It must, however, seem to be
      loaned by another. I want you to lend this money on mortgage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Heinzman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a one tenth of Orde's share in case he does not meet those notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he vill meet the notes,&rdquo; objected Heinzman. &ldquo;You are a prosperous
      concern. I know somethings of YOUR business, also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks he will,&rdquo; rejoined Newmark grimly. &ldquo;I will merely point out to
      you that his entire income is from the firm, and that from this income he
      must save twenty-odd thousand a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the firm has hard luck&mdash;&rdquo; said Heinzman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; finished Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vy you come to me?&rdquo; demanded Heinzman at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm offering you a chance to get even with Orde. I don't imagine
      you love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vat's de matter mit my gettin' efen with you, too?&rdquo; cried Heinzman.
      &ldquo;Ain't you beat me out at Lansing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark smiled coldly under his clipped moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm offering you the chance of making anywhere from thirty to fifty
      thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. And suppose this liddle scheme don't work out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; pursued Newmark calmly, &ldquo;I'll carry you over in your present
      obligations.&rdquo; He suddenly hit the arm of his chair with his clenched fist.
      &ldquo;Heinzman, if you don't make those July payments, what's to become of you?
      Where's your timber and your mills and your new house&mdash;and that
      pretty daughter of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman winced visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vill get an extension of time,&rdquo; said he feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; countered Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked each other in the eye for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, maybe,&rdquo; laughed Heinzman uneasily. &ldquo;It looks to me like a winner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; said Newmark briskly. &ldquo;I'll make out a mortgage at ten
      per cent for you, and you'll lend the money on it. At the proper time, if
      things happen that way, you will foreclose. That's all you have to do with
      it. Then, when the timber land comes to you under the foreclose, you will
      reconvey an undivided nine-tenths' interest&mdash;for proper
      consideration, of course, and without recording the deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman laughed with assumed lightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I fool you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I guess I joost keep it for mineself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark looked at him coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;You may remember the member from Lapeer County
      in that charter fight? And the five hundred dollars for his vote? Try it
      on, and see how much evidence I can bring up. It's called bribery in this
      State, and means penitentiary usually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't take a joke,&rdquo; complained Heinzman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's understood, then?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so I know you play fair?&rdquo; asked the German.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't. It's a case where we have to depend more or less on each
      other. But I don't see what you stand to lose&mdash;and anyway you'll get
      carried over those July payments,&rdquo; Newmark reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman was plainly uneasy and slightly afraid of these new waters in
      which he swam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you reduce the firm's profits, he iss going to suspect,&rdquo; he
      admonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said anything about reducing the firm's profits?&rdquo; said Newmark
      impatiently. &ldquo;If it does work out that way, we'll win a big thing; if it
      does not, we'll lose nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded to Heinzman and left the office. His demeanour was as dry and
      precise as ever. No expression illuminated his impassive countenance. If
      he felt the slightest uneasiness over having practically delivered his
      intentions to the keeping of another, he did not show it. For one thing,
      an accomplice was absolutely essential. And, too, he held the German by
      his strongest passions&mdash;his avarice, his dread of bankruptcy, his
      pride, and his fear of the penitentiary. As he entered the office of his
      own firm, his eye fell on Orde's bulky form seated at the desk. He paused
      involuntarily, and a slight shiver shook his frame from head to foot&mdash;the
      dainty, instinctive repulsion of a cat for a large robustious dog.
      Instantly controlling himself, he stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've made the loan,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked up with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The banks wouldn't touch northern peninsula,&rdquo; said Newmark steadily, &ldquo;so
      I had to go to private individuals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you said. Don't care who deals it out,&rdquo; laughed Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thayer backed out, so finally I got the whole amount from Heinzman,&rdquo;
       Newmark announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't know the old Dutchman was that well off,&rdquo; said Orde, after a
      slight pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't tell about those secretive old fellows,&rdquo; said Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know he was friendly enough to lend us money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business is business,&rdquo; replied Newmark.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      There exists the legend of an eastern despot who, wishing to rid himself
      of a courtier, armed the man and shut him in a dark room. The victim knew
      he was to fight something, but whence it was to come, when, or of what
      nature he was unable to guess. In the event, while groping tense for an
      enemy, he fell under the fatal fumes of noxious gases.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment Orde completed the secret purchase of the California
      timber lands from Trace, he became an unwitting participant in one of the
      strangest duels known to business history. Newmark opposed to him all the
      subtleties, all the ruses and expedients to which his position lent
      itself. Orde, sublimely unconscious, deployed the magnificent resources of
      strength, energy, organisation, and combative spirit that animated his
      pioneer's soul. The occult manoeuverings of Newmark called out fresh
      exertions on the part of Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark worked under this disadvantage: he had carefully to avoid the
      slightest appearance of an attitude inimical to the firm's very best
      prosperity. A breath of suspicion would destroy his plans. If the smallest
      untoward incident should ever bring it clearly before Orde that Newmark
      might have an interest in reducing profits, he could not fail to tread out
      the logic of the latter's devious ways. For this reason Newmark could not
      as yet fight even in the twilight. He did not dare make bad sales, awkward
      transactions. In spite of his best efforts, he could not succeed, without
      the aid of chance, in striking a blow from which Orde could not recover.
      The profits of the first year were not quite up to the usual standard, but
      they sufficed. Newmark's finesse cut in two the firm's income of the
      second year. Orde roused himself. With his old-time energy of resource, he
      hurried the woods work until an especially big cut gave promise of
      recouping the losses of the year before. Newmark found himself struggling
      against a force greater than he had imagined it to be. Blinded and bound,
      it nevertheless made head against his policy. Newmark was forced to a
      temporary quiescence. He held himself watchful, intent, awaiting the
      opportunity which chance should bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chance seemed by no means in haste. The end of the fourth year found
      Newmark puzzled. Orde had paid regularly the interest on his notes. How
      much he had been able to save toward the redemption of the notes
      themselves his partner was unable to decide. It depended entirely on how
      much the Ordes had disbursed in living expenses, whether or not Orde had
      any private debts, and whether or not he had private resources. In the
      meantime Newmark contented himself with tying up the firm's assets in such
      a manner as to render it impossible to raise money on its property when
      the time should come.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Orde regarded as a series of petty annoyances had made the problem of
      paying for the California timber a matter of greater difficulty than he
      had supposed it would be. A pressure whose points of support he could not
      place was closing slowly on him. Against this pressure he exerted himself.
      It made him a trifle uneasy, but it did not worry him. The margin of
      safety was not as broad as he had reckoned, but it existed. And in any
      case, if worse came to worst, he could always mortgage the California
      timber for enough to make up the difference&mdash;and more. Against this
      expedient, however, he opposed a sentimental obstinacy. It was Bobby's,
      and he objected to encumbering it. In fact, Orde was capable of a
      prolonged and bitter struggle to avoid doing so. Nevertheless, it was
      there&mdash;an asset. A loan on its security would, with what he had set
      aside, more than pay the notes on the northern peninsula stumpage. Orde
      felt perfectly easy in his mind. He was in the position of many of our
      rich men's sons who, quite sincerely and earnestly, go penniless to the
      city to make their way. They live on their nine dollars a week, and go
      hungry when they lose their jobs. They stand on their own feet, and yet&mdash;in
      case of severe illness or actual starvation&mdash;the old man is there! It
      gives them a courage to be contented on nothing. So Orde would have gone
      to almost any lengths to keep free &ldquo;Bobby's tract,&rdquo; but it stood always
      between himself and disaster. And a loan on western timber could be paid
      off just as easily as a loan on eastern timber; when you came right down
      to that. Even could he have known his partner's intentions, they would, on
      this account, have caused him no uneasiness, however angry they would have
      made him, or however determined to break the partnership. Even though
      Newmark destroyed utterly the firm's profits for the remaining year and a
      half the notes had to run, he could not thereby ruin Orde's chances. A
      loan on the California timber would solve all problems now. In this
      reasoning Orde would have committed the mistake of all large and generous
      temperaments when called upon to measure natures more subtle than their
      own. He would have underestimated both Newmark's resources and his own
      grasp of situations. [*]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The author has considered it useless to burden the course
     of the narrative with a detailed account of Newmark's
     financial manoeuvres. Realising, however, that a large class
     of his readers might be interested in the exact particulars,
     he herewith gives a sketch of the transactions.

     It will be remembered that at the time&mdash;1878&mdash;Orde first
     came in need of money for the purpose of buying the
     California timber, the firm, Newmark and Orde, owned in the
     northern peninsula 300,000,000 feet of pine. On this they
     had paid $150,000, and owed still a like amount. They
     borrowed $75,000 on it, giving a note secured by mortgage
     due in 1883. Orde took this, giving in return his note
     secured by the Boom Company's stock. In 1879 and 1880 they
     made the two final payments on the timber; so that by the
     latter date they owned the land free of encumbrance save for
     the mortgage of $75,000. Since Newmark's plan had always
     contemplated the eventual foreclosure of this mortgage, it
     now became necessary further to encumber the property.
     Otherwise, since a property worth considerably above
     $300,000 carried only a $75,000 mortgage, it would be
     possible, when the latter came due, to borrow a further sum
     on a second mortgage with which to meet the obligations of
     the first. Therefore Newmark, in 1881, approached Orde with
     the request that the firm raise $70,000 by means of a second
     mortgage on the timber. This $70,000 he proposed to borrow
     personally, giving his note due in 1885 and putting up the
     same collateral as Orde had&mdash;that is to say, his stock in
     the Boom Company. To this Orde could hardly in reason oppose
     an objection, as it nearly duplicated his own transaction of
     1878. Newmark therefore, through Heinzman, lent this sum to
     himself.

     It may now be permitted to forecast events in the line of
     Newmark's reasoning.

     If his plans should work out, this is what would happen: in
     1883 the firm's note for $75,000 would come due. Orde would
     be unable to pay it. Therefore at once his stock in the Boom
     Company would become the property of Newmark and Orde.
     Newmark would profess himself unable to raise enough from
     the firm to pay the mortgage. The second mortgage from which
     he had drawn his personal loan would render it impossible
     for the firm to raise more money on the land. A foreclosure
     would follow. Through Heinzman, Newmark would buy in. As he
     had himself loaned the money to himself&mdash;again through
     Heinzman&mdash;on the second mortgage, the latter would occasion
     him no loss.

     The net results of the whole transaction would be: first,
     that Newmark would have acquired personally the 300,000,000
     feet of northern peninsula timber; and, second, that Orde's
     personal share in the stock company would flow be held in
     partnership by the two. Thus, in order to gain so large a
     stake, it would pay Newmark to suffer considerable loss
     jointly with Orde in the induced misfortunes of the firm.

     Incidentally it might be remarked that Newmark, of course,
     purposed paying his own note to the firm when it should fall
     due in 1885, thus saving for himself the Boom Company stock
     which he had put up as collateral.
</pre>
    <p>
      Affairs stood thus in the autumn before the year the notes would come due.
      The weather had been beautiful. A perpetual summer seemed to have embalmed
      the world in its forgetfulness of times and seasons. Navigation remained
      open through October and into November. No severe storms had as yet swept
      the lakes. The barge and her two tows had made one more trip than had been
      thought possible. It had been the intention to lay them up for the winter,
      but the weather continued so mild that Orde suggested they be laden with a
      consignment for Jones and Mabley, of Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did intend to ship by rail,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They're all 'uppers,' so it would
      pay all right. But we can save all kinds of money by water, and they ought
      to skip over there in twelve to fifteen hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the three vessels were laid alongside the wharves at the
      mill, and as fast as possible the selected lumber was passed into their
      holds. Orde departed for the woods to start the cutting as soon as the
      first belated snow should fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      This condition seemed, however, to delay. During each night it grew cold.
      The leaves, after their blaze and riot of colour, turned crisp and crackly
      and brown. Some of the little, still puddles were filmed with what was
      almost, but not quite ice. A sheen of frost whitened the house roofs and
      silvered each separate blade of grass on the lawns. But by noon the sun,
      rising red in the veil of smoke that hung low in the snappy air, had
      mellowed the atmosphere until it lay on the cheek like a caress. No breath
      of wind stirred. Sounds came clearly from a distance. Long V-shaped
      flights of geese swept athwart the sky, very high up, but their honking
      came faintly to the ear. And yet, when the sun, swollen to the great
      dimensions of the rising moon, dipped blood-red through the haze; the
      first premonitory tingle of cold warned one that the grateful warmth of
      the day had been but an illusion of a season that had gone. This was not
      summer, but, in the quaint old phrase, Indian summer, and its end would be
      as though the necromancer had waved his wand.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Newmark, sitting at his desk, reported Captain Floyd of the steam barge
      NORTH STAR.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All loaded by noon, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark looked up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why do you tell me?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My orders? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a bad time of year,&rdquo; explained Captain Floyd, &ldquo;and the storm
      signal's up. All the signs are right for a blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark whirled in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A blow!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What of it? You don't come in every time it blows, do
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know the lakes, sir, at this time of year,&rdquo; insisted Captain
      Floyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo; sneered Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Floyd's countenance burned a dark red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only want your orders,&rdquo; was all he said. &ldquo;I thought we might wait to
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go,&rdquo; snapped Newmark. &ldquo;That lumber must get to the market. You heard
      Mr. Orde's orders to sail as soon as you were loaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Floyd nodded curtly and went out without further comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark arose and looked out of the window. The sun shone as balmily soft
      as ever. English sparrows twittered and fought outside. The warm smell of
      pine shingles rose from the street. Only close down to the horizon lurked
      cold, flat, greasy-looking clouds; and in the direction of the Government
      flag-pole he caught the flash of red from the lazily floating signal. He
      was little weatherwise, and he shook his head sceptically. Nevertheless it
      was a chance, and he took it, as he had taken a great many others.

    <h2>
      XXXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      To Carroll's delight, Orde returned unexpectedly from the woods late that
      night. He was so busy these days that she welcomed any chance to see him.
      Much to his disappointment, Bobby had been taken duck-hunting by his old
      friend, Mr. Kincaid. Next morning, however, Orde told Carroll his stay
      would be short and that his day would be occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd take old Prince and get some air,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;You're too much
      indoors. Get some friend and drive around. It's fine and blowy out, and
      you'll get some colour in your cheeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast Carroll accompanied her husband to the front door. When
      they opened it a blast of air rushed in, whirling some dead leaves with
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess the fine weather's over,&rdquo; said Orde, looking up at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dull lead colour had succeeded the soft gray of the preceding balmy
      days. The heavens seemed to have settled down closer to the earth. A
      rising wind whistled through the branches of the big maple trees,
      snatching the remaining leaves in handfuls and tossing them into the air.
      The tops swayed like whips. Whirlwinds scurried among the piles of dead
      leaves on the lawns, scattering them, chasing them madly around and around
      in circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-r-r-r!&rdquo; shivered Carroll. &ldquo;Winter's coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kept herself busy about the house all the morning; ate her lunch in
      solitude. Outside, the fierce wind, rising in a crescendo shriek, howled
      around the eaves. The day darkened, but no rain fell. At last Carroll
      resolved to take her husband's advice. She stopped for Mina Heinzman, and
      the two walked around to the stable, where the men harnessed old Prince
      into the phaeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove, the wind at their backs, across the drawbridge, past the
      ship-yards, and out beyond the mills to the Marsh Road. There, on either
      side the causeway, miles and miles of cat-tails and reeds bent and
      recovered under the snatches of the wind. Here and there showed glimpses
      of ponds or little inlets, the surface of the water ruffled and dark blue.
      Occasionally one of these bayous swung in across the road. Then the two
      girls could see plainly the fan-like cat's-paws skittering here and there
      as though panic-stricken by the swooping, invisible monster that pursued
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll and Mina Heinzman had a good time. They liked each other very
      much, and always saw a great deal to laugh at in the things about them and
      in the subjects about which they talked. When, however, they turned toward
      home, they were forced silent by the mighty power of the wind against
      them. The tears ran from their eyes as though they were crying; they had
      to lower their heads. Hardly could Carroll command vision clear enough to
      see the road along which she was driving. This was really unnecessary, for
      Prince was buffeted to a walk. Thus they crawled along until they reached
      the turn-bridge, where the right-angled change in direction gave them
      relief. The river was full of choppy waves, considerable in size. As they
      crossed, the SPRITE darted beneath them, lowering her smokestack as she
      went under the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered Main Street, where was a great banging and clanging of
      swinging signs and a few loose shutters. All the sidewalk displays of
      vegetables and other goods had been taken in, and the doors, customarily
      wide open, were now shut fast. This alone lent to the street quite a
      deserted air, which was emphasised by the fact that actually not a rig of
      any sort stood at the curbs. Up the empty roadway whirled one after the
      other clouds of dust hurried by the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder where all the farmers' wagons are?&rdquo; marvelled the practical
      Mina. &ldquo;Surely they would not stay home Saturday afternoon just for this
      wind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Opposite Randall's hardware store her curiosity quite mastered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do stop!&rdquo; she urged Carroll. &ldquo;I want to run in and see what's the
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was gone but a moment, and returned, her eyes shining with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Carroll!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;there are three vessels gone ashore off the
      piers. Everybody's gone to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump in!&rdquo; said Carroll. &ldquo;We'll drive out. Perhaps they'll get out the
      life-saving crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove up the plank road over the sand-hill, through the beech woods,
      to the bluff above the shore. In the woods they were somewhat sheltered
      from the wind, although even there the crash of falling branches and the
      whirl of twigs and dead leaves advertised that the powers of the air were
      abroad; but when they topped the last rise, the unobstructed blast from
      the open Lake hit them square between the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably a hundred vehicles of all descriptions were hitched to trees just
      within the fringe of woods. Carroll, however, drove straight ahead until
      Prince stood at the top of the plank road that led down to the bath
      houses. Here she pulled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll saw the lake, slate blue and angry, with white-capped billows to
      the limit of vision. Along the shore were rows and rows of breakers,
      leaping, breaking, and gathering again, until they were lost in a tumble
      of white foam that rushed and receded on the sands. These did not look to
      be very large until she noticed the twin piers reaching out from the
      river's mouth. Each billow, as it came in, rose sullenly above them, broke
      tempestuously to overwhelm the entire structure of their ends, and ripped
      inshore along their lengths, the crest submerging as it ran every foot of
      the massive structures. The piers and the light-houses at their ends
      looked like little toys, and the compact black crowd of people on the
      shore below were as small as Bobby's tin soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there&mdash;out farther!&rdquo; pointed Mina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll looked, and rose to her feet in excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three little toy ships&mdash;or so they seemed compared to the mountains
      of water&mdash;lay broadside-to, just inside the farthest line of
      breakers. Two were sailing schooners. These had been thrown on their beam
      ends, their masts pointing at an angle toward the beach. Each wave, as it
      reached, stirred them a trifle, then broke in a deluge of water that for a
      moment covered their hulls completely from sight. With a mighty suction
      the billow drained away, carrying with it wreckage. The third vessel was a
      steam barge. She, too, was broadside to the seas, but had caught in some
      hole in the bar so that she lay far down by the head. The shoreward side
      of her upper works had, for some freakish reason, given away first, so now
      the interior of her staterooms and saloons was exposed to view as in the
      cross-section of a model ship. Over her, too, the great waves hurled
      themselves, each carrying away its spoil. To Carroll it seemed
      fantastically as though the barge were made of sugar, and that each sea
      melted her precisely as Bobby loved to melt the lump in his chocolate by
      raising and lowering it in a spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the queer part of it all was that these waves, so mighty in their
      effects, appeared to the woman no different from those she had often
      watched in the light summer blows that for a few hours raise the &ldquo;white
      caps&rdquo; on the lake. They came in from the open in the same swift yet
      deliberate ranks; they gathered with the same leisurely pauses; they broke
      with the same rush and roar. They seemed no larger, but everything else
      had been struck small&mdash;the tiny ships, the toy piers, the ant-like
      swarm of people on the shore. She looked on it as a spectacle. It had as
      yet no human significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellows!&rdquo; cried Mina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see them?&rdquo; queried the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll looked, and in the rigging of the schooner she made out a number
      of black objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are those men?&mdash;up the masts?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set Prince in motion toward the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the bluff the plank road ran out into the deep sand.
      Through this the phaeton made its way heavily. The fine particles were
      blown in the air like a spray, mingling with the spume from the lake,
      stinging Carroll's face like so many needles. Already the beach was strewn
      with pieces of wreckage, some of it cast high above the wash, others still
      thrown up and sucked back by each wave, others again rising and falling in
      the billows. This wreckage constituted a miscellaneous jumble, although
      most of it was lumber from the deck-loads of the vessels. Intermingled
      with the split and broken yellow boards were bits of carving and of
      painted wood. Carroll saw one piece half buried in the sand which bore in
      gilt two huge letters, A R. A little farther, bent and twisted, projected
      the ornamental spear which had pointed the way before the steamer's bow.
      Portions of the usual miscellaneous freight cargo carried on every voyage
      were scattered along the shore&mdash;boxes, barrels, and crates. Five or
      six men had rolled a whisky barrel beyond the reach of the water, had
      broached it, and now were drinking in turn from a broken and dingy
      fragment of a beer-schooner. They were very dirty; their hair had fallen
      over their eyes, which were bloodshot; the expression of their faces was
      imbecile. As the phaeton passed, they hailed its occupants in thick
      voices, shouting against the wind maudlin invitations to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd gathered at the pier comprised fully half the population of
      Monrovia. It centred about the life saving crew, whose mortar was being
      loaded. A stove-in lifeboat mutely attested the failure of other efforts.
      The men worked busily, ramming home the powder sack, placing the
      projectile with the light line attached, attending that the reel ran
      freely. Their chief watched the seas and winds through his glasses. When
      the preparations were finished, he adjusted the mortar, and pulled the
      string. Carroll had seen this done in practice. Now, with the recollection
      of that experience in mind, she was astonished at the feeble report of the
      piece, and its freedom from the dense white clouds of smoke that should
      have enveloped it. The wind snatched both noise and vapour away almost as
      soon as they were born. The dart with its trailer of line rose on a long
      graceful curve. The reel sang. Every member of the crowd unconsciously
      leaned forward in attention. But the resistance of the wind and the line
      early made itself felt. Slower and slower hummed the reel. There came a
      time when the missile seemed to hesitate, then fairly to stand in
      equilibrium. Finally, in an increasingly abrupt curve, it descended into
      the sea. By a good three hundred yards the shot had failed to carry the
      line over the vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Mr. Bradford,&rdquo; said Carroll, waving her hand. &ldquo;I wish he'd come
      and tell us something about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The banjo-playing village Brummell saw the signal and came, his face
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't they get the lifeboats out to them?&rdquo; asked Carroll as he
      approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that one,&rdquo; said Bradford, pointing. &ldquo;Well, the other's in
      kindling wood farther up the beach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody drowned?&rdquo; asked Mina quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we got 'em out. Mr. Cam's shoulder is broken.&rdquo; He glanced down at
      himself comically, and the girls for the first time noticed that beneath
      the heavy overcoat his garments were dripping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely they'll never get a line over with the mortar!&rdquo; said Carroll.
      &ldquo;That last shot fell so far short!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know it. They've shot a dozen times. Might as well do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; said Mina, &ldquo;that they'd shoot from the end of the pier.
      They'd be ever so much nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tried it,&rdquo; replied Bradford succinctly. &ldquo;Nearly lost the whole business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody said anything for some time, but all looked helplessly to where the
      vessels&mdash;from this elevation insignificant among the tumbling waters&mdash;were
      pounding to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment from the river a trail of black smoke became visible over
      the point of sand-hill that ran down to the pier. A smokestack darted into
      view, slowed down, and came to rest well inside the river-channel. There
      it rose and fell regularly under the influence of the swell that swung in
      from the lake. The crowd uttered a cheer, and streamed in the direction of
      the smokestack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see what's up,&rdquo; suggested Bradford.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hitched Prince to a log sticking up at an angle from the sand, and led
      the way to the pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they had difficulty in getting close enough to see; but Bradford,
      preceding the two women, succeeded by patience and diplomacy in forcing a
      way. The SPRITE was lying close under the pier, the top of her pilot-house
      just about level with the feet of the people watching her. She rose and
      fell with the restless waters. Fat rope-yarn bumpers interposed between
      her sides and the piling. The pilot-house was empty, but Harvey, the negro
      engineer, leaned, elbows crossed against the sill of his little square
      door, smoking his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't go out there for a million dollars!&rdquo; cried a man excitedly to
      Carroll and Bradford. &ldquo;Nothing on earth could live in that sea! Nothing!
      I've run a tug myself in my time, and I know what I'm talking about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they going to do?&rdquo; asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you heard!&rdquo; cried the other, turning to her. &ldquo;Where you been?
      This is one of Orde's tugs, and she's going to try to get a line to them
      vessels. But I wouldn't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradford did not wait for him to finish. He turned abruptly, and with an
      air of authority brushed toward the tug, followed closely by Carroll and
      Mina. At the edge of the pier was the tug's captain, Marsh, listening to
      earnest expostulation by a half-dozen of the leading men of the town,
      among whom were both Newmark and Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the three came within earshot Captain Marsh spit forth the stump of
      cigar he had been chewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he crisply, &ldquo;that isn't the question. I think I can do
      it; and I'm entirely willing to take all personal risks. The thing is
      hazardous and it's Mr. Orde's tug. It's for him to say whether he wants to
      risk her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, man, what's the tug in a case like this!&rdquo; cried Orde, who was
      standing near. Carroll looked at him proudly, but she did not attempt to
      make her presence known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; replied Captain Marsh. &ldquo;So it's settled. I'll take her
      out, if I can get a crew. Harvey, step up here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer slowly hoisted his long figure through the breast-high
      doorway, dragged his legs under him, then with extraordinary agility swung
      to the pier, his teeth shining like ivory in his black face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas, suh!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harvey,&rdquo; said Captain Marsh briskly, &ldquo;we're going to try to get a line
      aboard those vessels out there. It's dangerous. You don't have to go if
      you don't want to. Will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey removed his cap and scratched his wool. The grin faded from his
      good-natured countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You-all goin', suh?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I'll done haif to go, too,&rdquo; said Harvey simply. Without further
      word he swung lightly back to the uneasy craft below him, and began to
      toss the slabs from the deck into the hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a man with me at the wheel, two to handle the lines, and one to
      fire for Harvey,&rdquo; said Captain Marsh to the crowd in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's our job,&rdquo; announced the life-saving captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come on then. No use in delay,&rdquo; said Captain Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four men from the life-saving service dropped aboard. The five then
      went over the tug from stem to stern, tossing aside all movables, and
      lashing tight all essentials. From the pilot-house Captain Marsh
      distributed life preservers. Harvey declined his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whaf-for I want dat?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Lots of good he gwine do me down
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then all hatches were battened down. Captain Marsh reached up to shake the
      hand which Orde, stooping, offered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll try to bring her back all right, sir,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hell with the tug!&rdquo; cried Orde, impatient at this insistence on the
      mere property aspect. &ldquo;Bring yourself back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Marsh deliberately lit another cigar and entered the pilot-house
      with the other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cast off!&rdquo; he cried; and the silent crowd heard clearly the single sharp
      bell ringing for attention, and then the &ldquo;jangler&rdquo; that called for full
      speed ahead. Awed, they watched the tiny sturdy craft move out into the
      stream and point to the fury of the open lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave chaps! Brave chaps!&rdquo; said Dr. McMullen to Carroll as they turned
      away. The physician drew his tall slender figure to its height. &ldquo;Brave
      chaps, every one of them. But, do you know, to my mind, the bravest of
      them all are that nigger&mdash;and his fireman&mdash;nailed down in the
      hold where they can't see nor know what's going on, and if&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;
       the good doctor blew his nose vigorously five or six times&mdash;&ldquo;well,
      it's just like a rat in a hole.&rdquo; He shook his head vigorously and looked
      out to sea. &ldquo;I read last evening, sir,&rdquo; said he to Bradford, &ldquo;in a blasted
      fool medical journal I take, that the race is degenerating. Good God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tug had rounded the end of the pier. The first of her thousand
      enemies, sweeping in from the open, had struck her fair. A great sheet of
      white water, slanting back and up, shot with terrific impact against the
      house and beyond. For an instant the little craft seemed buried; but
      almost immediately the gleam of her black hull showed her plunging forward
      dauntlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nothin'!&rdquo; said the tug captain who had first spoken. &ldquo;Wait 'til
      she gets outside!&rdquo; The watchers streamed down from the pier for a better
      view. Carroll and Miss Heinzman followed. They saw the staunch little
      craft drive into three big seas, each of which appeared to bury her
      completely, save for her upper works. She managed, however, to keep her
      headway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can stand that, all right,&rdquo; said one of the life-saving crew who had
      been watching her critically. &ldquo;The trouble will come when she drops down
      to the vessels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the heavy smashing of head-on seas the SPRITE held her course
      straight out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's she going, anyway?&rdquo; marvelled little Mr. Smith, the stationer.
      &ldquo;She's away beyond the wrecks already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably Marsh has found the seas heavier than he thought and is afraid
      to turn her broadside,&rdquo; guessed his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid, hell!&rdquo; snorted a riverman who overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the SPRITE was now so distant that the loom of the great seas
      on the horizon swallowed her from view, save when she rose on the crest of
      some mighty billow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is he doing 'way out there then?&rdquo; challenged Mr. Smith's
      friend with some asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do'no,&rdquo; replied the riverman, &ldquo;but whatever it is, it's all right as long
      as Buck Marsh is at the wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, she's turned now,&rdquo; Mr. Smith interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the trail of black smoke she had shifted direction. And then with
      startling swiftness the SPRITE darted out of the horizon into full view.
      For the first time the spectators realised the size and weight of the
      seas. Not even the sullen pounding to pieces of the vessels on the bar had
      so impressed them as the sight of the tug coasting with railroad speed
      down the rush of a comber like a child's toy-boat in the surf. One moment
      the whole of her deck was visible as she was borne with the wave; the next
      her bow alone showed high as the back suction caught her and dragged her
      from the crest into the hollow. A sea rose behind. Nothing of the tug was
      to be seen. It seemed that no power or skill could prevent her feeling
      overwhelmed. Yet somehow always she staggered out of the gulf until she
      caught the force of the billow and was again cast forward like a chip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe they ain't catchin' p'ticular hell at that wheel to hold her from
      yawing!&rdquo; muttered the tug captain to his neighbour, who happened to be Mr.
      Duncan, the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost before Carroll had time to see that the little craft was coming in,
      she had arrived at the outer line of breakers. Here the combers, dragged
      by the bar underneath, crested, curled over, and fell with a roar, just as
      in milder weather the surf breaks on the beach. When the SPRITE rushed at
      this outer line of white-water, a woman in the crowd screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the edge of destruction the SPRITE came to a shuddering stop. Her
      powerful propellers had been set to the reverse. They could not hold her
      against the forward fling of the water, but what she lost thus she
      regained on the seaward slopes of the waves and in their hollows. Thus she
      hovered on the edge of the breakers, awaiting her chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as the seas rolled in steadily, and nothing broke, she was safe.
      But if one of the waves should happen to crest and break, as many of them
      did, the weight of water catching the tug on her flat, broad stern deck
      would indubitably bury her. The situation was awful in its extreme
      simplicity. Would Captain Marsh see his opportunity before the law of
      chances would bring along the wave that would overwhelm him?
    </p>
    <p>
      A realisation of the crisis came to the crowd on the beach. At once the
      terrible strain of suspense tugged at their souls. Each conducted himself
      according to his nature. The hardy men of the river and the woods set
      their teeth until the cheek muscles turned white, and blasphemed softly
      and steadily. Two or three of the townsmen walked up and down the space of
      a dozen feet. One, the woman who had screamed, prayed aloud in short
      hysterical sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God! Save them, O Lord! O Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde stood on top of a half-buried log, his hat in his hand, his entire
      being concentrated on the manoeuvre being executed. Only Newmark
      apparently remained as calm as ever, leaning against an upright timber,
      his arms folded, and an unlighted cigar as usual between his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Methodically every few moments he removed his eyeglasses and wiped the
      lenses free of spray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, without warning, occurred one of those inexplicable lulls that
      interpose often amid the wildest uproars. For the briefest instant other
      sounds than the roar of the wind and surf were permitted the multitude on
      the beach. They heard the grinding of timbers from the stricken ships, and
      the draining away of waters. And distinctly they heard the faint, far
      tinkle of the jangler calling again for &ldquo;full speed ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between two waves the SPRITE darted forward directly for the nearest of
      the wrecks. Straight as an arrow's flight she held until from the crowd
      went up a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll collide!&rdquo; some one put it into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the latest moment the tug swerved, raced past, and turned on a long
      diagonal across the end of the bar toward the piers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Marsh had chosen his moment with exactitude. To the utmost he had
      taken advantage of the brief lull of jumbled seas after the &ldquo;three largest
      waves&rdquo; had swept by. Yet in shallow water and with the strong inshore set,
      even that lull was all too short. The SPRITE was staggered by the buffets
      of the smaller breakers; her speed was checked, her stern was dragged
      around. For an instant it seemed that the back suction would hold her in
      its grip. She tore herself from the grasp of the current. Enveloped in a
      blinding hail of spray she struggled desperately to extricate herself from
      the maelstrom in which she was involved before the resumption of the
      larger seas should roll her over and over to destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already these larger seas were racing in from the open. To Carroll,
      watching breathless and wide-eyed in that strange passive and receptive
      state peculiar to imaginative natures, they seemed alive. And the SPRITE,
      too, appeared to be, not a fabric and a mechanism controlled by men, but a
      sentient creature struggling gallantly on her own volition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far out in the lake against the tumbling horizon she saw heave up for a
      second the shoulder of a mighty wave. And instinctively she perceived this
      wave as a deadly enemy of the little tug, and saw it bending all its great
      energies to hurrying in on time to catch the victim before it could
      escape. To this wave she gave all her attention, watching for it after it
      had sunk momentarily below its fellows, recognising it instantly as it
      rose again. The spasms of dismay and relief among the crowd about her she
      did not share at all. The crises they indicated did not exist for her.
      Until the wave came in, Carroll knew, the SPRITE, no matter how battered
      and tossed, would be safe. Her whole being was concentrated in a
      continually shifting calculation of the respective distances between the
      tug and the piers, the tug and the relentlessly advancing wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go!&rdquo; she exhorted the SPRITE under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the crowd, too, caught with its slower perceptions the import of the
      wave. Carroll felt the electric thrill of apprehension shiver through it.
      Huge and towering, green and flecked with foam the wave came on now calmly
      and deliberately as though sure. The SPRITE was off the end of the pier
      when the wave lifted her, just in the position her enemy would have
      selected to crush her life out against the cribs. Slowly the tug rose
      against its shoulder, was lifted onward, poised; and then with a swift
      forward thrust the wave broke, smothering the pier and lighthouse beneath
      tons of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low, agonised wail broke from the crowd. And then&mdash;and then&mdash;over
      beyond the pier down which the wave, broken and spent but formidable
      still, was ripping its way, they saw gliding a battered black stack from
      which still poured defiantly clouds of gray smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten seconds the spectators could not believe their eyes. They had
      distinctly seen the SPRITE caught between a resistless wall of water and
      the pier; where she should have been crushed like the proverbial
      egg-shell. Yet there she was&mdash;or her ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a great cheer rose up against the wind. The crowd went crazy. Mere
      acquaintances hugged each other and danced around and around through the
      heavy sands. Several women had hysterics. The riverman next to Mr. Duncan
      opened his mouth and swore so picturesquely that, as he afterward told his
      chum, &ldquo;I must've been plumb inspired for the occasion.&rdquo; Yet it never
      entered Mr. Duncan's ministerial head to reprove the blasphemy. Orde
      jumped down from his half-buried log and clapped his hat on his head.
      Newmark did not alter his attitude nor his expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SPRITE was safe. For the few moments before she glided the length of
      the long pier to stiller water this fact sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if she got the line aboard,&rdquo; speculated the tug-boat captain at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd surged over to the piers again. Below them rose and fell the
      SPRITE. All the fancy scroll-work of her upper works, the cornice of her
      deck house, the light rigging of her cabin had disappeared, leaving raw
      and splintered wood to mark their attachments. The tall smokestack was
      bent awry, but its supports had held, which was fortunate since otherwise
      the fires would have been drowned out. At the moment, Captain Marsh was
      bending over examining a bad break in the overhang&mdash;the only material
      damage the tug had sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of him the crowd set up a yell. He paid no attention. One of the
      life-saving men tossed a mooring line ashore. It was seized by a dozen
      men. Then for the first time somebody noticed that although the tug had
      come to a standstill, her screw was still turning slowly over and over,
      holding her against the erratic strong jerking of a slender rope that ran
      through her stern chocks and into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got it aboard!&rdquo; yelled the man, pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cheer broke out. The life-saving crew leaped to the deck. They
      were immediately followed by a crowd of enthusiasts eager to congratulate
      and question. But Captain Marsh would have none of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get off my tug!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Do you want to swamp her? What do you
      suppose we put that line aboard for? Fun? Get busy and use it! Rescue that
      crew now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abashed, the enthusiasts scrambled back. The life-saving crew took charge.
      It was necessary to pass the line around the end of the pier and back to
      the beach. This was a dangerous job, and one requiring considerable power
      and ingenuity, for the strain on the line imposed by the waters was
      terrific; and the breaking seas rendered work on the piers extremely
      hazardous. However, the life-saving captain took charge confidently
      enough. His crew began to struggle out the pier, while volunteers, under
      his personal direction, manipulated the reel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of the curious lingered about the SPRITE. Marsh and Orde were in
      consultation over the smashed stern, and did not look as though they cared
      to be disturbed. Harvey leaned out his little square door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don' know nuffin 'bout it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;'ceptin' she done rolled 'way over
      'bout foh times. Yass she did, suh! I know. I felt her doin' it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered a query. &ldquo;I wasn't what you-all would call scairt, that
      is, not really SCAIRT&mdash;jess a little ne'vous. All I had to do was to
      feed her slabs and listen foh my bell. You see, Cap'n Ma'sh, he was in
      cha'ge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; Captain Marsh was saying emphatically to his employer. &ldquo;I can't
      figure it out except on one thing. You see it's stove from UNDERNEATH. A
      sea would have smashed it from above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you grounded in between seas out there,&rdquo; suggested Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marsh smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I'd have known it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No, sir! It sounds wild, but it's
      the only possible guess. That last sea must've lifted us bodily right over
      the corner of the pier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;maybe,&rdquo; assented Orde doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; repeated Marsh with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'd better not tell 'em so unless you want to rank in with Old
      Man Ananias,&rdquo; ended Orde. &ldquo;It was a good job. Pretty dusty out there,
      wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty dusty,&rdquo; grinned Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned away together and were at once pounced on by Leopold Lincoln
      Bunn, the local reporter, a callow youth aflame with the chance for a big
      story of more than local interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Captain Marsh!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;How did you get around the pier? It looked
      as though the wave had you caught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde glanced at his companion in curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On roller skates,&rdquo; replied Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leopold tittered nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you tell me how you felt when you were out there in the worst of
      it?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo; said Marsh grumpily, stalking away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't interview for a cent, does he?&rdquo; grinned Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Orde! Perhaps you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think we'd better lend a hand below?&rdquo; suggested Orde, pointing
      to the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild and picturesque work of rescue was under way. The line had been
      successfully brought to the left of the lighthouse. To it had been
      attached the rope, and to that the heavy cable. These the crew of the
      schooner had dragged out and made fast to a mast. The shore end passed
      over a tall scissors. When the cable was tightened the breeches buoy was
      put into commission, and before long the first member of the crew was
      hauled ashore, plunging in and out of the waves as the rope tightened or
      slackened. He was a flaxen-haired Norwegian, who stamped his feet, shook
      his body and grinned comically at those about him. He accepted with
      equanimity a dozen drinks of whisky thrust at him from all sides, swigged
      a mug of the coffee a few practical women were making over an open fire,
      and opposed to Leopold Lincoln Bunn's frantic efforts a stolid and
      baffling density. Of none of these attentions did he seem to stand in
      especial need.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew and its volunteers worked quickly. When the last man had come
      ashore, the captain of the life-saving service entered the breeches buoy
      and caused himself to be hauled through the smother to the wreck. After an
      interval, a signal jerked back. The buoy was pulled in empty and the surf
      car substituted. In it were piled various utensils of equipment. One man
      went with it, and several more on its next trip, until nearly the whole
      crew were aboard the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll and Mina stayed until dusk and after, watching the long heavy
      labour of rescue. Lines had to be rocketed from the schooner to the other
      vessels. Then by their means cable communication had to be established
      with the shore. After this it was really a matter of routine to run the
      crew to the beach, though cruel, hard work, and dangerous. The wrecks were
      continually swept by the great seas; and at any moment the tortured
      fabrics might give way, might dissolve completely in the elements that so
      battered them. The women making the hot coffee found their services
      becoming valuable. Big fires of driftwood were ignited. They were useful
      for light as well as warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      By their illumination finally Orde discovered the two girls standing, and
      paused long enough in his own heavy labour of assistance to draw Carroll
      one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better go home now, sweetheart,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Bobby'll be waiting for
      you, and the girls may be here in the crowd somewhere. There'll be nobody
      to take care of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; she assented. &ldquo;But hasn't it been exciting? Whose vessels
      were they; do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde glanced at her strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were ours,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him, catching quickly the wrinkles of his brow and the
      harassed anxiety in his eyes. Impulsively she pulled him down to her and
      kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, dear,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I care only if you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She patted his great shoulders lightly and smiled up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run, help!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And come home as soon as you can. I'll have
      something nice and hot all ready for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, the smile still on her lips; but as soon as she was out
      of sight, her face fell grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Mina!&rdquo; she said to the younger girl. &ldquo;Time to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They toiled through the heavy sand to where, hours ago, they had left
      Prince. That faithful animal dozed in his tracks and awoke reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll looked back. The fires leaped red and yellow. Against them were
      the silhouettes of people, and in the farther circle of their illumination
      were more people cast in bronze that flickered red. In contrast to their
      glow the night was very dark. Only from the lake there disengaged a faint
      gray light where the waters broke. The strength of the failing wind still
      lifted the finer particles of sand. The organ of the pounding surf filled
      the night with the grandeur of its music.

    <h2>
      XXXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde mounted the office stairs next day with a very heavy step. The loss
      of the NORTH STAR and of the two schooners meant a great deal to him at
      that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It kicks us into somewhat of a hole,&rdquo; he grumbled to Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A loss is never pleasant,&rdquo; replied the latter, &ldquo;and it puts us out of the
      carrying business for awhile. But we're insured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't understand why Floyd started,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;He ought to know
      better than to face sure prospects of a fall blow. I'll tan his soul for
      that, all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I'm partly responsible for his going,&rdquo; put in Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; cried Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You see that Smith and Mabley shipment was important enough to
      strain a point for&mdash;and it's only twenty-four hours or so&mdash;and
      it certainly didn't look to see me as if it were going to blow very soon.
      Poor Floyd feels bad enough. He's about sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde for the first time began to appreciate the pressure of his
      circumstances. The loss on the cargo of &ldquo;uppers&rdquo; reached about 8,000,000
      feet; which represented $20,000 in money. As for the NORTH STAR and her
      consorts, save for the insurance, they were simply eliminated. They had
      represented property. Now they were gone. The loss of $60,000 or so on
      them, however, did not mean a diminution of the company's present cash
      resources to that amount; and so did not immediately affect Orde's
      calculations as to the payment of the notes which were now soon to come
      due.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the woods work increasingly demanded his attention. He
      disappeared for a week, his organising abilities claimed for the
      distribution of the road crews. When he returned to the office, Newmark,
      with an air of small triumph, showed him contracts for the construction of
      three new vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I get them for $55,000,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with $30,000 of it on long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without consulting me!&rdquo; cried Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark explained carefully that the action, seemingly so abrupt, had
      really been taking advantage of a lucky opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Otherwise,&rdquo; he finished, &ldquo;we shouldn't have been able to get the job done
      for another year, at least. If that big Cronin contract goes through&mdash;well,
      you know what that would mean in the shipyards&mdash;nobody would get even
      a look-in. And McLeod is willing, in the meantime, to give us a price to
      keep his men busy. So you see I had to close at once. You can see what a
      short chance it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a good chance, all right,&rdquo; admitted Orde; &ldquo;but&mdash;why&mdash;that
      is, I thought perhaps we'd job our own freighting for awhile&mdash;it
      never occurred to me we'd build any more vessels until we'd recovered a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recovered,&rdquo; Newmark repeated coldly. &ldquo;I don't see what 'recovered' has to
      do with it. If the mill burned down, we'd rebuild, wouldn't we? Even if we
      were embarrassed&mdash;which we're not&mdash;we'd hardly care to
      acknowledge publicly that we couldn't keep up our equipment. And as we're
      making twelve or fifteen thousand a year out of our freighting, it seems
      to me too good a business to let slip into other hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; agreed Orde, a trifle helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore I had to act without you,&rdquo; Newmark finished. &ldquo;I knew you'd
      agree. That's right: isn't it?&rdquo; he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's right,&rdquo; agreed Orde drearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find copies of the contract on your desk,&rdquo; Newmark closed the
      matter. &ldquo;And there's the tax lists. I wish you'd run them over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; replied Orde, &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't think I'll stay down town this
      morning. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark glanced up keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't look a bit well,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;kind of pale around the gills.
      Bilious. Don't believe that camp grub quite agrees with you for a steady
      diet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that must be it,&rdquo; assented Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his desk and went out. Newmark turned back to his papers. His
      face was expressionless. From an inner pocket he produced a cigar which he
      thrust between his teeth. The corners of his mouth slowly curved in a grim
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde did not go home. Instead, he walked down Main Street to the docks
      where he jumped into a rowboat lying in a slip, and with a few rapid
      strokes shot out on the stream. In his younger days he had belonged to a
      boat club, and had rowed in the &ldquo;four.&rdquo; He still loved the oar, and though
      his racing days were past, he maintained a clean-lined, rather unstable
      little craft which it was his delight to propel rapidly with long
      spoon-oars whenever he needed exercise. To-day, however, he was content to
      drift.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was still and golden. The crispness of late fall had infused a
      wine into the air. The sky was a soft, blue-gray; the sand-hills were a
      dazzling yellow. Orde did not try to think; he merely faced the situation,
      staring it in the face until it should shrink to its true significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing he felt distinctly; yet could not without a struggle bring
      himself to see. The California lands must be mortgaged. If he could raise
      a reasonable sum of money on them, he would still be perfectly able to
      meet his notes. He hated fiercely to raise that money.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was entirely a matter of sentiment. Orde realised the fact clearly, and
      browbeat his other self with a savage contempt. Nevertheless his dream had
      been to keep the western timber free and unencumbered&mdash;for Bobby.
      Dreams are harder to give up than realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell into the deepest reflections which were broken only when the
      pounding of surf warned him he had drifted almost to the open lake. After
      all, there was no essential difference between owing money to a man in
      Michigan and to a man in California. That was the net result of his
      struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the time comes, we'll just borrow that money on a long-time
      mortgage, like sensible people,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;and quit this everlasting
      scrabbling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back to town he pulled with long vigorous strokes, skittering his
      feathered spoon-oars lightly over the tops of the wavelets. At the slip he
      made fast the boat, and a few minutes later re-entered the office, his
      step springy, his face glowing. Newmark glanced up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Back again? You look better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exercise,&rdquo; said Orde, in his hearty manner. &ldquo;Exercise, old boy! You ought
      to try it. Greatest thing in the world. Just took a row to the end of the
      piers and back, and I'm as fit as a fiddle!&rdquo;
     </p>

      XXXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde immediately set into motion the machinery of banking to borrow on the
      California timber. Taylor took charge of this, as the only man in Monrovia
      who had Orde's confidence. At the end of a necessary delay Orde received
      notice that the West had been heard from. He stepped across the hall to
      the lawyer's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Frank,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;glad we managed to push it through with so little
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taylor arose, shut carefully the door into his outer office, walked to the
      window, looked contemplatively out upon the hotel backyard, and returned
      to his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is trouble,&rdquo; said he curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The banks refuse the loan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde stared at him in blank astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refuse!&rdquo; he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What grounds can they possibly have for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't make out exactly from these advices. It's something about the
      title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought you went over the title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; stated Taylor emphatically; &ldquo;and I'll stake my reputation as a
      lawyer that everything is straight and clear from the Land Office itself.
      I've wired for an explanation; and we ought surely to know something
      definite by tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this uncertainty Orde was forced to be content. For the first time in
      his business career a real anxiety gnawed at his vitals. He had been in
      many tight places; but somehow heretofore success or failure had seemed to
      him about immaterial, like points gained or conceded in the game; a fresh
      start was always so easy, and what had been already won as yet unreal. Now
      the game itself was at issue. Property, reputation, and the family's
      future were at stake. When the three had lived in the tiny house by the
      church, it had seemed that no adversity could touch them. But now that
      long use had accustomed them to larger quarters, servants, luxuries, Orde
      could not conceive the possibility of Carroll's ever returning to that
      simplest existence. Carroll could have told him otherwise; but of course
      he did not as yet bring the possibility before her. She had economised
      closely, these last few years. Orde was proud of her. He was also fiercely
      resentful that his own foolishness, or untoward circumstances, or a
      combination of both should jeopardise her future. Therefore he awaited
      further news with the greatest impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The message came the following day, as Taylor had predicted. Taylor handed
      it to him without comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land Office under investigation,&rdquo; Orde read. &ldquo;Fraudulent entries
      suspected. All titles clouded until decision is reached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose that means?&rdquo; asked Orde, although he knew well
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taylor glanced up at his dull eyes with commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They simply won't lend good money on an uncertainty,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; said Orde, rousing himself with an effort, &ldquo;I've got to be here.
      I couldn't get away this winter if my life depended on it. And I won't
      even have time to pay much attention to it from here. I want you to go to
      California and look after those interests for me. Never mind your
      practice, man,&rdquo; as Taylor tried to interrupt him. &ldquo;Make what arrangements
      you please; but go. It'll be like a sort of vacation to you. You need one.
      And I'll make it worth your while. Take Clara with you. She'll like
      California. Now don't say no. It's important. Straighten it out as quick
      as you can: and the minute it IS straight borrow that money on it, and
      send it on p.d.q.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taylor thoughtfully tapped his palm with the edge of his eye-glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Orde, rising and holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended the dark stairs to the street, where he turned down toward
      the river. There he sat on a pile for nearly an hour, quite oblivious to
      the keen wind of latter November which swept up over the scum ice from the
      Lake. At length he hopped down and made his way to the office of the
      Welton Lumber Co.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Welton,&rdquo; he demanded abruptly when he had reached that
      operator's private office, &ldquo;how much of a cut are you going to make this
      year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About twenty million,&rdquo; replied Welton. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just figuring on the drive,&rdquo; said Orde, nodding a farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the team harnessed, and, assuming his buffalo-fur coat, drove to
      the offices of all the men owning timber up and down the river. When he
      had collected his statistics, he returned to his desk, where he filled the
      backs of several envelopes with his characteristically minute figures. At
      the close of his calculations he nodded his head vigorously several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; he called across to his partner, &ldquo;I'm going to cut that whole forty
      million we have left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark did not turn. After a moment his dry expressionless voice came
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that we figured that as a two-years' job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did, but I'm going to clean up the whole thing this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you can do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; replied Orde. Then under his breath, and quite to himself,
      he added: &ldquo;I've got to!&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      The duel had now come to grapples. Orde was fighting for his very life.
      The notes given by Newmark and Orde would come due by the beginning of the
      following summer. Before that time Orde must be able to meet them
      personally, or, as by the agreement with Newmark, his stock in the Boom
      Company would be turned in to the firm. This would, of course, spell
      nearly a total loss of it, as far as Orde was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief anxiety under which the riverman laboured, however, was the
      imminent prospect of losing under the mortgage all the Northern Peninsula
      timber. He had thought that the firm would be able to step in for its
      redemption, even if he personally found himself unable to meet the
      obligation. Three hundred million feet would seem to be too important a
      matter to let go under so small a mortgage. Now as the time approached, he
      realised that if he could not pay the notes, the firm would certainly be
      unable to do so. What with the second mortgage, due two years later, and
      to be met by Newmark; with the outstanding obligations; with the new
      enterprise of the vessels ordered from Duncan McLeod, Newmark and Orde
      would be unable to raise anything like the necessary amount. To his
      personal anxieties Orde added a deep and bitter self-reproach at having
      involved his partner in what amounted to a total loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spurred doubly by these considerations, then, he fell upon the woods work
      with unparalleled ferocity. A cut and sale of the forty million feet
      remaining of the firm's up-river holdings, together with the tolls to be
      collected for driving the river that spring would, if everything went
      right and no change in the situation took place, bring Orde through the
      venture almost literally by &ldquo;the skin of his teeth.&rdquo; To cut forty million
      feet, even in these latter days of improvements then unknown, would be a
      task to strain to the utmost every resource of energy, pluck, equipment
      and organisation. In 1880-81 the operators on the river laughed
      good-humouredly over an evident madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless Orde accomplished the task. To be sure he was largely helped
      by a favourable winter. The cold weather came early and continued late.
      Freezing preceded the snow, which was deep enough for good travoying and
      to assure abundant freshet water in the spring, but not too deep to
      interfere with the work. Orde increased his woods force; and, contrary to
      his custom, he drove them mercilessly. He was that winter his own
      walking-boss, and lived constantly in the woods. The Rough Red had charge
      of the banking, where his aggressive, brutal personality kept the rollways
      free from congestion. For congestion there means delay in unloading the
      sleighs; and that in turn means a drag in the woods work near the skidways
      at the other end of the line. Tom North and Tim Nolan and Johnny Sims and
      Jim Denning were foremen back in the forest. Every one had an idea, more
      or less vague, that the Old Fellow had his back to the wall. Late into the
      night the rude torches, made quite simply from brown stone jugs full of
      oil and with wicks in their necks, cast their flickering glare over the
      ice of the haul-roads. And though generally in that part of Michigan the
      thaws begin by the first or second week in March, this year zero weather
      continued even to the eighth of April. When the drive started, far up
      toward headwaters, the cut was banked for miles along the stream, forty
      million feet of it to the last timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strain over, Orde slept the clock around and awoke to the further but
      familiar task of driving the river. He was very tired; but his spirit was
      at peace. As always after the event, he looked back on his anxieties with
      a faint amusement over their futility.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Taylor he had several communications. The lawyer confessed himself
      baffled as to the purpose and basis of the Land Office investigation. The
      whole affair appeared to be tangled in a maze of technicalities and a
      snarl of red-tape which it would take some time to unravel. In the
      meantime Taylor was enjoying himself; and was almost extravagant in his
      delight over the climate and attractions of Southern California.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde did not much care for this delay. He saw his way clear to meeting his
      obligations without the necessity of hypothecating the California timber;
      and was the better pleased for it. With the break-up of spring he started
      confidently with the largest drive in the history of the river, a matter
      of over two hundred million feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tremendous mass of timber moved practically in three sections. The
      first, and smallest, comprised probably thirty millions. It started from
      the lowermost rollways on the river, drove rapidly through the more
      unobstructed reaches, and was early pocketed above Monrovia in the
      Company's distributing booms. The second and largest section of a hundred
      million came from the main river and its largest tributaries. It too made
      a safe drive; and was brought to rest in the main booms and in a series of
      temporary or emergency booms built along the right bank and upstream from
      the main works. The third section containing a remainder of about seventy
      million had by the twenty-sixth of June reached the slack water above the
      city of Redding.

    <h2>
      XXXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning of June twenty-sixth dawned clear. Orde was early on the road
      before the heat of the day. He drove his buckboard rapidly over the twelve
      miles that separated his home from the distributing booms, for he wanted
      at once to avoid the heat of the first sun and to arrive at the
      commencement of the day's work. After a glance at the river, he entered
      the tiny office and set about the examination of the tally sheets left by
      the foreman. While he was engaged in this checking, the foreman, Tom
      North, entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The river's rising a little&rdquo;? he remarked conversationally as he reached
      for the second set of tally boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're crazy,&rdquo; muttered Orde, without looking up. &ldquo;It's clear as a bell;
      and there have been no rains reported from anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's rising a little, just the same,&rdquo; insisted North, going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Orde, having finished his clerical work, walked out over the
      booms. The water certainly had risen; and considerably at that. A decided
      current sucked through the interstices in the piling. The penned logs
      moved uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it was rising!&rdquo; said Orde to himself, as he watched the
      slowly moving water. &ldquo;I wonder what's up. It can't be merely those rains
      three days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called one of the younger boys to him, Jimmy Powers by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Jimmy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;mark one of these piles and keep track of how
      fast the water rises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time the river remained stationary, then resumed its slow
      increase. Orde shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like June floods,&rdquo; he told Tom North. &ldquo;A fellow can understand an
      ordinary spring freshet, and knows about how far it will go; but these
      summer floods are so confounded mysterious. I can't figure out what's
      struck the old stream, unless they're having almighty heavy rains up near
      headwaters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By three o'clock in the afternoon Jimmy Powers reported a rise since
      morning of six inches. The current had proportionately increased in power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Orde to the old riverman, &ldquo;I'm going to send Marsh down for
      the pile-drivers and some cable. The barge company has some fifteen inch
      manilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      North laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in blazes do you expect to do with that?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may need them,&rdquo; Orde stated with conviction. &ldquo;Everything's safe enough
      now; and probably will continue so; but I can't afford to take chances. If
      those logs ever break through they'll go on out to Lake Michigan and there
      they wouldn't be worth the salvage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom North stared at his principal in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a mighty long chance,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Never knew you to come so
      near croaking before, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this drive goes out, it surely busts me,&rdquo; replied Orde, &ldquo;and I'm not
      taking even long chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Marsh, returning with the SPRITE, brought an evening paper and
      news from the telegraph offices. A cloudburst in the China Creek district
      followed by continued heavy rains was responsible for the increased water.
      The papers mentioned this only incidentally, and in explanation. Their
      columns were filled with an account of the big log jam that had formed
      above the iron railroad bridge. The planing mill's booms had given way
      under pressure and the contents had piled down stream against the
      buttresses. Before steps could be taken to clear the way, the head of the
      drive, hurried by the excess water, had piled in on top. Immediately a jam
      formed, increasing in weight each moment, until practically the entire
      third section had piled up back of the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The papers occupied themselves with the picturesque side of the affair.
      None expressed any anxiety as to the bridge. It was a new structure, each
      of whose bents weighed over a hundred tons. A fall of a few inches only
      would suffice to lock the jam solidly, thus relieving whatever pressure
      the mass exerted against the iron bridge. That the water would shortly go
      down was of course inevitable at this time of year. It would be a big jam
      for the rivermen to break, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you'll go up there?&rdquo; asked North.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're in a nice pickle,&rdquo; he acknowledged; &ldquo;but Nolan's in charge and
      will do his best. I think we may have troubles of our own right here at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slept that night at the booms. The water, contrary to all expectation,
      rose steadily. By morning it had crept so far up the piles that there
      began to be danger that it would overflow their tops. In that case, of
      course, the logs in the booms would also run out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess it's time we did a little work,&rdquo; remarked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set a crew of men to raising the height of the piling by tying logs
      firmly to the bolted timbers atop. This would take care of an extra two
      feet of water; a two feet beyond all previous records. Another crew
      stretched the fifteen inch manilla cables across the field of logs in
      order to segregate them into several units of mass, and so prevent them
      from piling up at the down-stream end of the enclosure. The pile-driver
      began to drop its hammer at spots of weakness. In spite of the accelerated
      current and the increased volume of the river, everything was soon
      shipshape and safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're all right now,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;The only thing I'm a little uneasy
      about is those confounded temporary booms upstream. Still they're all
      right unless they get to piling up. Then we'll have to see what we can do
      to hold them. I think as soon as the driver is through down at the sorting
      end, she'd better drive a few clumps of piles to strengthen the swing when
      it is shut. Then if the logs pile down on us from above, we can hold them
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About two hours later the pile-driver moved up. The swing was opened; and
      the men began to drive clumps of piles in such a position as to strengthen
      the swing when the latter should be shut. It was a slow job. Each pile had
      to be taken from the raft at the stern of the scow, erected in the
      &ldquo;carrier,&rdquo; and pounded into place by the heavy hammer raised and let drop
      in the derrick at the bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before the task was finished, the logs in the temporary booms had
      begun to slide atop one another, to cross and tangle, until at last the
      river bed inside the booms was filled with a jam of formidable dimensions.
      From beneath it the water boiled in eddies. Orde, looking at it, roused
      himself to sudden activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a move on,&rdquo; he advised Captain Aspinwall of the driver. &ldquo;If that jam
      breaks on us, we want to be ready; and if it don't break before you get
      this swing strengthened, maybe we can hold her where she is. There's no
      earthly doubt that those boom piles will never stand up when they get the
      full pressure of the freshet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He departed up river on a tour of inspection from which he returned almost
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry up! Hurry up!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She can't last much longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed even to the men on the pile-driver, evidences of the pressure
      sustained by the slender boom piles were not wanting. Above the steady
      gurgle of the water and the intermittent puffing and other noises of the
      work, they could hear a creaking and groaning of timbers full of portent
      to those who could read the signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver's crew laboured desperately, hoisting the piles into the
      carriage, tripping the heavy hammer, sending it aloft again, binding
      feverishly the clumps of piles together by means of cables. Each man
      worked with an eye over his shoulder, fearful of the power that menaced
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the clumps had been placed and bound; a third was nearly finished,
      when suddenly, with a crack and a roar the upper booms gave way,
      projecting their logs upon the opening and the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half dozen members of the crew, caught utterly unaware in spite of the
      half warning they had been receiving for an hour past, were scattered by
      the winds of a panic. Two or three flung themselves on their faces;
      several ran from one end of the scow to the other; one leaped into the
      river! Imminent destruction seemed upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom North, at the winch that operated the arm of the swing, however,
      retained his presence of mind. At the first sag outward of the boom piles
      he set in operation the machinery that closed the gate. Clumsy and slow as
      was his mechanism, he nevertheless succeeded in getting the long arm
      started. The logs, rushing in back of it, hurried it shut. Immediately
      they jammed again, and heaped up in a formidable tangle behind the
      barrier. Tom North, his little black pipe between his teeth, stood calm,
      the lever of his winch in his hand. A short three feet from the spot on
      which he stood, the first saw log of the many that might have overwhelmed
      him thrust forward its ugly head. The wash of the water lifted the huge
      pile-driver bodily and deposited it with a crash half on the bank and half
      in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly after the first break Orde had commenced running out over the
      booms from the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good boy, Tom!&rdquo; he shot at North as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the breast of the jam he hurried, and to the other bank where the
      pile-driver lay. The crew had recovered from their panic, and were ashore
      gazing curiously underneath the scow. Captain Aspinwall examined the
      supports of the derrick on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was lucky,&rdquo; said Orde briefly to Aspinwall. &ldquo;How's the damage? Stove
      you in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't think so,&rdquo; replied the captain, turning a rather
      perturbed face to Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good. I'll send over the tug to help get her afloat. We've got our
      work cut out for us now. As soon as you're afloat, blow your whistle and
      I'll come over to tell you what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't expect me to work my driver under the face of that jam!&rdquo; cried
      the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; snapped Orde, wheeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; said Aspinwall positively. &ldquo;I know when I've got enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't safe,&rdquo; replied the captain; &ldquo;and I don't intend to risk my men
      or my driver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde stood for a moment stock-still; then with a snort of anger he leaped
      to the deck, seized the man by the neck and thrust him bodily over the
      side to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe, you white-livered skunk!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Safe! Go over in the middle
      of that ten-acre lot and lie down on your face and see if you feel safe
      there! Get out; the whole pack of you! I'm in charge here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Aspinwall picked himself up, his face red with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get off my driver,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Put that man off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde seized a short heavy bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This driver is requisitioned,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Get out! I haven't time to fool
      with you. I've got to save my logs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hesitated; and while they did so Tom North and some others of the
      crew came running across the jam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a cable to the winch,&rdquo; Orde shouted at these as soon as they were
      within hearing. &ldquo;And get Marsh up here with the SPRITE. We've got to get
      afloat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paid no more attention to the ejected crew. The latter, overawed by the
      rivermen, who now gathered in full force, took the part of spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes' hard work put the driver afloat. Fortunately its raft of
      piles had not become detached in the upheaval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Orde briskly to North, &ldquo;you know the pile-driver business.
      Pick out your crew, and take charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In ten seconds of time the situation had changed from one of comparative
      safety to one of extreme gravity. The logs, broken loose from the upper
      temporary booms, now jammed against the swing and against the other logs
      already filling the main booms. Already the pressure was beginning to
      tell, as the water banked up behind the mass. The fifteen-inch cables
      tightened slowly but mightily; some of the piles began to groan and rub
      one against the other; here and there a log deliberately up-ended above
      the level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde took charge of the situation in its entirety, as a general might. He
      set North immediately to driving clumps each of sixteen piles, bound to
      solidity by chains, and so arranged in angles and slants as to direct the
      enormous pressure toward either bank, thus splitting the enemy's power.
      The small driver owned by the Boom Company drove similar clumps here,
      there and everywhere that need arose or weakness developed. Seventy-five
      men opposed, to the weight of twenty million tons of logs and a river of
      water, the expedients invented by determination and desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in a virulent disease, the symptoms developed rapidly when once the
      course of the malady was assured. After the first rush, when the upper
      booms broke, nothing spectacular occurred. Steadily and relentlessly the
      logs, packed close together down to the very bed of the stream, pressed
      outward against the frail defences. Orde soon found himself forced from
      the consideration of definite plans of campaign. He gave over formal
      defences, and threw his energies to saving the weak places which rapidly
      developed. By the most tremendous exertions he seemed but just able to
      keep even. So closely balanced was the equilibrium between the
      improvisation of defence and the increase of pressure behind the jam that
      it seemed as if even a moment's breathing spell would bring the deluge.
      Piles quivered, bent slowly outward&mdash;immediately, before the logs
      behind them could stir, the pile-driver must do its work. Back and forth
      darted the SPRITE and her sister-tug the SPRAY towing the pile-drivers or
      the strings of piles. Under the frowning destruction that a breath might
      loosen, the crews had to do their work. And if ever that breath should
      come, there would be no chance for escape. Crushed and buried, the men and
      their craft alike would be borne with the breaking jam to an unknown grave
      in the Lake. Every man knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness came. No one stopped for food. By the light of lanterns the
      struggle went on, doubly terrifying in the mystery of night. By day the
      men, practised in such matters, could at least judge of the probabilities
      of a break. At night they had to work blindly, uncertain at what moment
      the forces they could not see would cut loose to overwhelm them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning found no change in the situation. The water rose steadily; the
      logs grew more and more restive; the defences weaker and more inadequate.
      Orde brought out steaming pails of coffee which the men gulped down
      between moments. No one thought of quitting. They were afire with the
      flame of combat, and were set obstinately on winning even in the face of
      odds. About ten o'clock they were reinforced by men from the mills
      downstream. The Owners of those mills had no mind to lose their logs.
      Another pile-driver was also sent up from the Government work. Without
      this assistance the jam must surely have gone out. Spectators marvelled
      how it held as it did. The mass seemed constantly to quiver on the edge of
      motion. Here and there over the surface of the jam single logs could be
      seen popping suddenly into the air, propelled as an apple seed is
      projected from between a boy's thumb and forefinger. Some of the
      fifteen-inch cables stretched to the shore parted. One, which passed once
      around an oak tree before reaching its shore anchorage, actually buried
      itself out of sight in the hard wood. Bunches of piles bent, twisted, or
      were cut off as though they had been but shocks of Indian corn. The
      current had become so swift that the tugs could not hold the drivers
      against it; and as a consequence, before commencing operations, special
      mooring piles had to be driven. Each minute threatened to bring an end to
      the jam, yet it held; and without rest the dogged little insects under its
      face toiled to gain an inch on the waters.

      XXXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      All that day and the next night the fight was hand to hand, without the
      opportunity of a breathing space. Then Orde, bareheaded and dishevelled,
      strung to a high excitement, but cool as a veteran under fire, began to be
      harassed by annoyances. The piles provided for the drivers gave out.
      Newmark left, ostensibly to purchase more. He did not return. Tom North
      and Jim Denning, their eyes burning deep in their heads for lack of sleep,
      came to Orde holding to him symbolically their empty hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more piles,&rdquo; they said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get 'em,&rdquo; said Orde with equal brevity. &ldquo;Newmark will have enough here
      shortly. In the meantime, get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      North and his friend disappeared, taking with them the crews of the
      drivers and the two tugs. After an interval they returned towing small
      rafts of the long timbers. Orde did not make any inquiries; nor until days
      later did he see a copy of the newspaper telling how a lawless gang of
      rivermen had driven away the railroad men and stolen the railroad's
      property. These piles lasted five or six hours. Tom North placed and drove
      them accurately and deliberately, quite unmindful of the constant danger.
      A cold fire seemed to consume the man, inflaming his courage and his
      dogged obstinacy. Once a wing of the jam broke suddenly just as his crew
      had placed a pile in the carrier. The scow was picked up, whirled around,
      carried bodily a hundred feet, and deposited finally with a crash. The
      instant the craft steadied and even before any one could tell whether or
      no the danger was past, Tom cut loose the hammer and drove that pile!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put you in that carrier to be DROVE!&rdquo; he shouted viciously, &ldquo;and drove
      you'll be, if we ARE goin' to hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the SPRAY shouldered the scow back to position that one pile was left
      standing upright in the channel, a monument to the blind determination of
      the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately the wing break carried with it but a few logs; but it sufficed
      to show, if demonstration were needed, what would happen if any more
      serious break should occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde was everywhere. Long since he had lost his hat; and over his forehead
      and into his eyes the strands of his hair whipped tousled and unkempt.
      Miles and miles he travelled; running along the tops of the booms, over
      the surface of the jam, spying the weakening places, and hurrying to them
      a rescue. He seemed tireless, omnipresent, alive to every need. It was as
      though his personality alone held in correlation these struggling forces;
      as though were he to relax for an instant his effort they would burst
      forth with the explosion of long-pent energies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward noon the piles gave out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where in HELL is Newmark!&rdquo; exploded Orde, and immediately was himself
      again, controlled and resourceful. He sent North and a crew of men to cut
      piles from standing timber in farm wood lots near the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haul them out with your winch,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If the owners object, stand
      them off with your peavies. Get them anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About three of the afternoon the LUCY BELLE splattered up stream from the
      village, carrying an excursion to see the jam. Captain Simpson brought her
      as close in as possible. The waves raised by her awkward paddle-wheel and
      her clumsy lines surged among the logs and piles. Orde looked on this with
      distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go tell him to pull out of that,&rdquo; he instructed Jimmy Powers &ldquo;The
      confounded old fool ought to know better than that. Tell him it's
      dangerous. If the jam goes out, it'll carry him to Kingdom Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Powers returned red-faced from his interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me to go to hell,&rdquo; he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he did,&rdquo; snapped Orde. &ldquo;I should think we had enough without that old
      idiot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the short nervous leaps of a suppressed anger he ran down to where
      the SPRITE had just towed the Number One driver into a new position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay me alongside the LUCY BELLE,&rdquo; he told Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Simpson, in a position of importance at last, was disinclined to
      listen. He had worn his blue clothes and brass buttons for a good many
      years in charge only of boxes and barrels. Now at a stroke he found
      himself commander over tenscore people. Likewise, at fifty cents a head,
      he foresaw a good thing as long as high water should last. He had risen
      nobly to the occasion; for he had even hoisted his bunting and brought
      with him the local brass band. Orde, brusque in his desire to hurry
      through an affair of minor importance, rubbed the man the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I've some rights on this river,&rdquo; Captain Simpson concluded the
      argument, &ldquo;and I ain't agoin' to be bulldozed out of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The excursionists, typical &ldquo;trippers&rdquo; from Redding, Holland, Monrovia and
      Muskegon, cheered this sentiment and jeered at Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde nodded briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marsh,&rdquo; said he to his captain in a low voice, &ldquo;get a crew and take them
      in charge. Run 'em off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the tug touched the piling, he was off and away, paying no
      further attention to a matter already settled. Captain Marsh called a
      dozen rivermen to him; laid the SPRITE alongside the LUCY BELLE, and in
      spite of Simpson's scandalised protests and an incipient panic among the
      passengers, thrust aside the regular crew of the steamship and took
      charge. Quite calmly he surveyed the scene. From the height of the
      steamer's bridge he could see abroad over the country. A warm June sun
      flooded the landscape which was filled with the peace of early summer. The
      river seemed to flow smoothly and quietly enough, in spite of the
      swiftness of its current and the swollen volume of its waters. Only up
      stream where the big jam shrugged and groaned did any element jar on the
      peace of the scene; and even that, in contrast to the rest of the
      landscape, afforded small hint to the inexperienced eye of the imminence
      of a mighty destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Marsh paid little attention to all this. His eye swept rapidly up
      and down where the banks used to be until he saw a cross current deeper
      than the rest sweeping in athwart the inundated fields. He swung over the
      wheel and rang to the engine-room for half speed ahead. Slowly the LUCY
      BELLE answered. Quite calmly Captain Marsh rammed her through the opening
      and out over the cornfields. The LUCY BELLE was a typical river steamboat,
      built light in the draught in order to slide over the numerous shifting
      bars to be encountered in her customary business. When Captain Marsh saw
      that he had hit the opening, he rang for full speed, and rammed the poor
      old LUCY BELLE hard aground in about a foot of water through which a few
      mournful dried cornstalks were showing their heads. Then, his hands in his
      pockets, he sauntered out of the pilot-house to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now if you want to picnic,&rdquo; he told the astonished and frightened
      excursionists, &ldquo;go to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With entire indifference to the water, he vaulted over the low rail and
      splashed away. The rivermen and the engineer who had accompanied him
      lingered only long enough to start up the band.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you're safe as a cow tied to a brick wall,&rdquo; said the Rough Red, whose
      appearance alone had gone far toward overawing the passengers. &ldquo;Be joyful.
      Start up the music. Start her up, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The band hastily began to squawk, very much out of time, and somewhat out
      of tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; grinned the Rough Red savagely, &ldquo;keep her up. If you quit
      before I get back to work, I'll come back and take you apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They waded through the shallow water in the cornfield. After them wafted
      the rather disorganised strains of WHOA, EMMA. Captain Simpson was
      indulging in what resembled heat apoplexy. After a time the LUCY BELLE'S
      crew recovered their scattered wits sufficiently to transport the
      passengers in small boats to a point near the county road, whence all
      trudged to town. The LUCY BELLE grew in the cornfield until several weeks
      later, when time was found to pull her off on rollers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the booms Captain Marsh shook the loose water from his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; he reported to Orde. &ldquo;I ran 'em ashore yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked up, brushing the hair from his eyes. He glanced in the
      direction of the cornfield, and a quick grin flickered across the absorbed
      expression of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you did,&rdquo; said he briefly. &ldquo;I guess that'll end the
      excursion business. Now take Number Two up below the swing; and then run
      down and see if you can discover Tom. He went somewhere after piles about
      an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down river the various mill owners were busy with what men they had left
      in stringing defences across the river in case Orde's works should go out.
      When Orde heard this he swore vigourously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crazy fools,&rdquo; he spat out. &ldquo;They'd be a lot better off helping here. If
      this goes out, their little booms won't amount to a whiff of wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sent word to that effect; but, lacking the enforcement of his personal
      presence his messages did not carry conviction, and the panic-stricken
      owners continued to labour, each according to his ideas, on what Orde's
      clearer vision saw to be a series of almost comical futilities. However,
      Welton answered the summons. Orde hailed his coming with a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a dredge,&rdquo; he yelled, as soon as the lumberman was within
      distance. &ldquo;I believe we can relieve the pressure somewhat by a channel
      into Steam's bayou. Get that Government dredge up and through the bayou as
      soon as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Welton briefly. &ldquo;Can you hold her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to hold her,&rdquo; replied Orde between his clenched teeth. &ldquo;Have you
      seen Newmark? Where in HELL is Newmark? I need him for fifty things, and
      he's disappeared off the face of the earth! Purdy! that second cable!
      She's snapped a strand! Get a reinforcing line on her!&rdquo; He ran in the
      direction of the new danger without another thought of Welton.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the late afternoon casual spectators from the countryside had gathered
      in some number. The bolder or more curious of these added a further touch
      of anxiety to the situation by clambering out over the jam for a better
      view. Orde issued instructions that these should keep off the logs; but in
      spite of that, with the impertinent perseverance of the sight-seer, many
      persisted from time to time, when the rivermen were too busily engaged to
      attend to them, in venturing out where they were not only in danger but
      also in the way. Tom North would have none of this on his pile-driver. If
      a man was not actually working, he had no business on Number One.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested a spectator mildly, &ldquo;I OWN this driver. I haven't any
      objections to your grabbing her in this emergency, even if you did
      manhandle my captain; but surely you are not going to keep me off my own
      property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't give a tinker's damn who you are,&rdquo; replied North sturdily. &ldquo;If
      you're not working, you get off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And get off he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broad deck of the pile-driver scow was a tempting point from which to
      survey the work, and the ugly jam, and the water boiling angrily, and the
      hollow-eyed, dishevelled maniacs who worked doggedly with set teeth as
      though they had not already gone without two nights' sleep. North had
      often to order ashore intruders, until his temper shortened to the
      vanishing point. One big hulking countryman attempted to argue the point.
      North promptly knocked him overboard into the shallow water between the
      driver and the bank. He did not rise; so North fished for him in the most
      matter-of-fact way with a boat hook, threw him on the bank unconscious,
      and went on driving piles! The incident raised a laugh among the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But flesh and blood has its limit of endurance; and that limit was almost
      reached. Orde heard the first premonitions of reaction in the mild
      grumblings that arose. He knew these men well from his long experience
      with them. Although the need for struggle against the tireless dynamics of
      the river was as insistent as ever; although it seemed certain that a
      moment's cessation of effort would permit the enemy an irretrievable gain,
      he called a halt on the whole work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, irrelevantly, &ldquo;let's have a smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He set the example by throwing himself full length against a slanting pile
      and most leisurely filling his pipe. The men stared a moment; then
      followed his example. A great peace of evening filled the sky. The horizon
      lay low and black against the afterglow. Beneath it the river shone like
      silver. Only the groaning, the heave and shrugging of the jam, and the low
      threatening gurgle of hurrying waters reminded the toil-weary men of the
      enemy's continued activity. Over beyond the rise of land that lay between
      the river and Stearn's Bayou could be seen the cloud of mingled smoke and
      steam that marked the activities of the dredge. For ten minutes they
      rested in the solace of tobacco. Orde was apparently more at ease than any
      of the rest, but each instant he expected to hear the premonitory CRACK
      that would sound the end of everything. Finally he yawned, knocked the
      ashes from his pipe, and got to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, a new ring in his voice, &ldquo;come on and let's get something
      DONE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They responded to a man.

    <p>
      By midnight the water seemed to have gone down slightly. Half the crew
      snatched a little sleep. For several hours more the issue hung
      aggravatingly in equilibrium. Then, with the opening of the channel into
      Stearn's Bayou the heaviest pressure was relieved. For the moment the
      acute danger point was passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde spent the next two days in strengthening the defences. The men were
      able to take their quota of meals and of sleep. Merely the working hours
      were longer than usual. Orde himself slept little, and was still possessed
      by a feverish activity. The flood continued at about the same volume.
      Until the water should subside, the danger could not be considered
      completely over with.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these few days of comparative leisure Orde had time to look about him
      and to receive news. The jam had been successfully held at the iron
      railroad bridge above Redding; but only by the most strenuous efforts.
      Braces of oak beams had been slanted where they would do the most good;
      chains strengthened the weaker spots; and on top of all ton after ton of
      railroad iron held the whole immovably. Nolan had enjoyed the advantage of
      a &ldquo;floating&rdquo; jam; of convenient facilities incident to a large city; and
      of an aroused public sentiment that proffered him all the help he could
      use. Monrovia, little village that it was, had not grasped the situation.
      Redding saw it clearly. The loss of the timber alone&mdash;representing
      some millions of dollars' worth of the sawed product&mdash;would mean
      failure of mill companies, of banks holding their paper, and so of firms
      in other lines of business; and besides would throw thousands of men out
      of employment. Furthermore, what was quite as serious, should the iron
      bridge give way, the wooden bridges below could hardly fail to go out.
      Railroad communication between eastern and western Michigan would be
      entirely cut off. For a season industry of every description would be
      practically paralysed. Therefore Nolan had all the help he required. Every
      device known was employed to strengthen the jam. For only a few hours was
      the result in doubt. Then as the CLARION jubilantly expressed it, &ldquo;It's a
      hundred dollars to an old hat she holds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde received all this with satisfaction, but with a slight scepticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a floating jam; and it gets a push from underneath,&rdquo; he pointed out.
      &ldquo;It's probably safe; but another flood might send it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The floods are going down,&rdquo; said North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord; I hope so!&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark sent word that a sudden fit of sickness had confined him to the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't think of a little thing like piles,&rdquo; said Orde to himself. &ldquo;Well,
      that's hardly fair. Joe couldn't have realised when he left here just how
      bad things were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For two days, as has been said, nothing happened. Then Orde decided to
      break out a channel through the jam itself. This was a necessary
      preliminary to getting the logs in shape for distribution. An opening was
      made in the piles, and the rivermen, with pike-pole and peavy, began
      cautiously to dig their way through the tangled timbers. The Government
      pile-driver, which had finally been sent up from below, began placing five
      extra booms at intervals down stream to capture the drift as fast as it
      was turned loose. From the mills and private booms crews came to assist in
      the labour. The troubles appeared to be quite over, when word came from
      Redding that the waters were again rising. Ten minutes later Leopold
      Lincoln Bunn, the local reporter, came flapping in on Randall's old white
      horse, like a second Paul Revere, crying that the iron bridge had gone,
      and the logs were racing down river toward the booms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It just went out!&rdquo; he answered the eager exclamations of the men who
      crowded around him. &ldquo;That's all I know. It went out! And the other
      bridges! Sure! All but the Lake Shore! Don't know why that didn't go out.
      No; the logs didn't jam there; just slid right under!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; said Welton, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren't going to quit!&rdquo; cried Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. You're crazy!&rdquo; said Welton with some asperity. &ldquo;If they can't
      stop a little jam with iron, what are your wooden defences going to amount
      to against the whole accumulation? When those logs hit the tail of this
      jam, she'll go out before you can wink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He refused to listen to argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's sure death,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I'm not going to sacrifice my men for
      nothing, even if they'd stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Other owners among the bystanders said the same thing. An air of profound
      discouragement had fallen on them all. The strain of the fight was now
      telling. The utmost that human flesh and blood was capable of had been
      accomplished; a hard-won victory had been gained by the narrowest of
      narrow margins. In this new struggle the old odds were still against them,
      and in addition the strength that had pushed aside Redding's best effort,
      augmented by the momentum of a powerful current. It was small wonder they
      gave up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the news was spreading among the workers on the jams. As man
      shouted to man, each shouldered his peavy and came running ashore, eager
      question on his lips. Orde saw the Government driver below casting loose
      from her moorings. A moment later her tug towed her away to some side
      bayou of safety out of the expected rush to the Lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can hold her!&rdquo; cried Orde in desperation. &ldquo;Have a little nerve
      with you. You aren't going to quit like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swept them with his eye; then turned away from them with a gesture of
      despair. They watched him gravely and silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use, boy,&rdquo; said old Carlin; &ldquo;it's sure death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure death!&rdquo; Orde laughed bitterly. &ldquo;All right; sure death, then. Isn't
      there a man in this crowd that will tackle this sort of sure death with
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me,&rdquo; said North and the Rough Red in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Orde. &ldquo;You, too, Johnny Sims? and Purdy? and Jimmy Powers?
      Bully boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you'll need the tug,&rdquo; said Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen more of Orde's personal following volunteered. At once his good
      humour returned; and his easy leisurely confidence in himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to close that opening, first thing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Marsh, tow the
      pile-driver up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caused a heavy line to be run from a tree, situated around the bend
      down stream, to the stern of the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now if you have to,&rdquo; he told North, who had charge, &ldquo;let go all holds,
      and the line will probably swing you around out of danger. We on the tug
      will get out as best we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The opening was to be closed by piles driven in groups of sixteen bound
      together by chains. The clumps were connected one to the other by a system
      of boom logs and ropes to interpose a continuous barrier. The pile-driver
      placed the clumps; while the tug attended to the connecting defences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said Orde as his last word, &ldquo;if she starts to go, save
      yourselves the best way you can. Never mind the driver. STAY ON TOP!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the tug and her consort nosed up through the boiling water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's rising already,&rdquo; said Orde to Marsh, watching the water around the
      piles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that jam's going out before many minutes,&rdquo; supplemented the
      tugboat captain grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both these statements were only too true. Although not fifteen minutes
      before, the jam had lain locked in perfect safety, now the slight rise of
      the waters had lifted and loosened the mass until it rose fairly on the
      quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work fast!&rdquo; Orde called to the men on the pile-driver. &ldquo;If we can close
      the opening before those Redding logs hit us, we may be able to turn them
      into our new channel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not add that if the opening were not closed before the jam broke,
      as break it would in a very few moments, the probabilities were that both
      pile-driver and tug would be destroyed. Every man knew that already.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom North ordered a pile placed in the carriage; the hammer descended. At
      once, like battering rams logs began to shoot up from the depths of the
      river end foremost all about them. These timbers were projected with
      tremendous force, leaping sometimes half their length above the surface of
      the water. If any of them had hit either the tug or the pile-driver
      squarely, it would have stove and sunk the craft. Fortunately this did not
      happen; but Marsh hastily towed the scow back to a better position. The
      pile had evidently been driven into the foot of the jam itself, thus
      loosening timbers lying at the bottom of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work went forward as rapidly as possible. Four times the jam shrugged
      and settled; but four times it paused on the brink of discharge. Three of
      the clumps had been placed and bound; and fifteen piles of the last clump
      had been driven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more pile!&rdquo; breathed Orde, his breath quickening a trifle as he
      glanced up stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hammer in the high derrick ran smoothly to the top, paused, and fell.
      A half dozen times more it ripped. Then without delay the heavy chains
      were thrown around the winch, and the steam power began to draw the clumps
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried Tom North, straightening his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a job in time, too,&rdquo; said Johnny Sims, indicating the creaking and
      tottering jam.
    </p>
    <p>
      North unmoored, and the driver dropped back with the current and around
      the bend where she was snubbed by the safety line already mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the tug churned forward to accomplish the last duty, that of
      binding the defences together by means of chains and cables. Two men
      leaped to the floating booms and moved her fore and aft. Orde and the
      Rough Red set about the task. Methodically they worked from either end
      toward the middle. When they met finally, Orde directed his assistant to
      get aboard the tug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tie this one, Jimmy,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aboard the tug all was tense preparation. Marsh grasped alertly the spokes
      of the wheel. In the engine-room Harvey, his hand on the throttle, stood
      ready to throw her wide open at the signal. Armed with sharp axes two men
      prepared to cut the mooring lines on a sign from the Rough Red. They
      watched his upraised hand. When it should descend, their axes must fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; the Rough Red warned Orde, who was methodically tying the last
      cumbersome knot, &ldquo;she's getting ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde folded the knot over without reply. Up stream the jam creaked,
      groaned, settled deliberately forward, cutting a clump of piles like
      straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's coming!&rdquo; cried the Rough Red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me every second you can,&rdquo; said Orde, without looking up. He was just
      making the last turns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mass toppled slowly, fell into the swift current, and leaped with a
      roar. The Rough Red watched with cat-like attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump!&rdquo; he cried at last, and his right arm descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the shout and the motion several things happened simultaneously. Orde
      leaped blindly for the rail, where he was seized and dragged aboard by the
      Rough Red; the axes fell, Marsh whirled over the wheel, Harvey threw open
      his throttle. The tug sprang from its leash like a hound. And behind the
      barrier the logs, tossing and tumbling, the white spray flying before
      their onslaught, beat in vain against the barrier, like raging wild beasts
      whose prey has escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close call,&rdquo; said Orde briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet you,&rdquo; replied Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither referred to the tug's escape; but to the fortunate closing of the
      opening.

    <h2>
      XLI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde now took steps to deflect into the channel recently dredged to
      Stearn's Bayou the mass of the logs racing down stream from Redding. He
      estimated that he had still two hours or so in which to do the work. In
      this time he succeeded by the severest efforts in establishing a rough
      shunt into the new channel. The logs would come down running free. Only
      the shock of their impact against the tail of the jam already formed was
      to be feared. Orde hoped to be able to turn the bulk of them aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      This at first he succeeded in doing; and very successfully as affecting
      the pressure on the jam below. The first logs came scattering. Then in a
      little while the surface of the river was covered with them; they
      shouldered each other aside in their eagerness to outstrip the rushing
      water; finally they crowded down more slowly, hardly able to make their
      way against the choking of the river banks, but putting forth in the very
      effort to proceed a tremendous power. To the crew working in the channel
      dredged through to Steam's Bayou the affair was that of driving a rather
      narrow and swift stream, only exaggerated. By quick and skilful work they
      succeeded in keeping the logs in motion. A large proportion of the timbers
      found their way into the bayou. Those that continued on down the river
      could hardly have much effect on the jam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work was breathless in its speed. From one to another sweat-bathed,
      panting man the logs were handed on. As yet only the advance of the big
      jam had arrived at the dredged channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked about him and realised this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't keep this up when the main body hits us,&rdquo; he panted to his
      neighbour, Jim Denning. &ldquo;We'll have to do some more pile-driver work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a rapid excursion to the boom camp, whence he returned with thirty
      or forty of the men who had given up work on the jam below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you can at least keep these logs moving in this
      channel for a couple of hours. This isn't dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke quite without sarcastic intent; but the rivermen, already over
      their first panic, looked at each other a trifle shamefacedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tie into her wherever you say,&rdquo; said one big fellow. &ldquo;If you fellows
      are going back to the jam, I'm with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two or three more volunteered. The remainder said nothing, but in silence
      took charge of the dredged channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde and his men now returned to the jam where, on the pile-driver, the
      tugs, and the booms, they set methodically to strengthening the defences
      as well as they were able.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's holding strong and dandy,&rdquo; said Orde to Tom North, examining
      critically the clumps of piles. &ldquo;That channel helps a lot in more ways
      than one. It takes an awful lot of water out of the river. As long as
      those fellows keep the logs moving, I really believe we're all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But shortly the water began to rise again, this time fairly by leaps. In
      immediate response the jam increased its pressure. For the hundredth time
      the frail wooden defences opposed to millions of pounds were tested to the
      very extreme of their endurance. The clumps of piles sagged outward; the
      network of chains and cables tightened and tightened again, drawing ever
      nearer the snapping point. Suddenly, almost without warning, the situation
      had become desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the first time Orde completely lost his poise and became fluently
      profane. He shook his fist against the menacing logs; he apostrophised the
      river, the high water, the jam, the deserters, Newmark and his illness,
      ending finally in a general anathema against any and all streams, logs,
      and floods. Then he stormed away to see if anything had gone wrong at the
      dredged channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom North, &ldquo;they've got the old man real good and mad this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crew went on driving piles, stringing cables, binding chains,
      although, now that the inspiration of Orde's combative spirit was
      withdrawn the labours seemed useless, futile, a mere filling in of the
      time before the supreme moment when they would be called upon to pay the
      sacrifice their persistence and loyalty had proffered for the altar of
      self-respect and the invincibility of the human Soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the dredged channel Orde saw the rivermen standing idle, and,
      half-blind with anger he burst upon them demanding by this, that and the
      other what they meant. Then he stopped short and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Square across the dredged channel and completely blocking it lay a single
      span of an iron bridge. Although twisted and misshapen, it was still
      intact, the framework of its overhead truss-work retaining its cage-like
      shape. Behind it the logs had of course piled up in a jam, which, sinking
      rapidly to the bed of the channel, had dammed back the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where in hell did that drop from?&rdquo; cried Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down on top the jam,&rdquo; explained a riverman. &ldquo;Must have come way from
      Redding. We just couldn't SCARE her out of here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde, suddenly fallen into a cold rage, stared at the obstruction, both
      fists clenched at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad, boy,&rdquo; said Welton at his elbow. &ldquo;But don't take it too hard.
      You've done more than any of the rest of us could. And we're all losers
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked at him strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That about settles it,&rdquo; repeated Welton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Settle!&rdquo; cried Orde. &ldquo;I should think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Welton smiled quaintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know when you're licked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Licked, hell!&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;We've just begun to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get that bridge span out of there, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't we blow her up with powder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever try to blow up iron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is,&rdquo; replied Welton. &ldquo;Of course&mdash;take her apart bolt by
      bolt and nut by nut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send for the wrenches, then,&rdquo; snapped Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would take two or three days, even working night and day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would be too late&mdash;it would do no good&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; interrupted Orde; &ldquo;but it will be doing something, anyway.
      Look here, Welton, are you game? If you'll get that bridge out in two days
      I'll hold the jam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't hold that jam two hours, let alone two days,&rdquo; said Welton
      decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my business. You're wasting time. Will you send for lanterns and
      wrenches and keep this crew working?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Welton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the next two days the old scenes were all relived, with back of
      them the weight of the struggle that had gone before. The little crew
      worked as though mad. Excepting them, no one ventured on the river, for to
      be caught in the imminent break meant to die. Old spars, refuse timbers of
      all sorts&mdash;anything and everything was requisitioned that might help
      form an obstruction above or below water. Piles were taken where they
      could be found. Farmer's trees were cut down. Pines belonging to divers
      and protesting owners were felled and sharpened. Some were brought in by
      rail. Even the inviolate Government supply was commandeered. The Railroad
      Company had a fine lot which, with remarkable shortsightedness and lack of
      public spirit, they refused to sell at any price. The crew took them by
      force. Once Captain Marsh was found up to his waist in water, himself
      felling the trees of a wood, and dragging them to the river by a cable
      attached to the winch of his tug. Night followed day; and day night again.
      None of the crews realised the fact. The men were caught in the toils of a
      labour ceaseless and eternal. Never would it end, just as never had it
      begun. Always were they to handle piles, steam hammers and the implements
      of their trade, menaced by a jam on the point of breaking, wet by a
      swollen and angry flood, over-arched by a clear calm sky or by the
      twinkling peaceful stars. Long since had they ceased to reckon with the
      results of what they did, the consequences either to themselves or to the
      jam. Mechanically they performed their labour. Perhaps the logs would kill
      them. Perhaps these long, black, dripping piles they drove were having
      some effect on the situation. Neither possibility mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all at once, as though a faucet had been turned off, the floods
      slackened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've opened the channel,&rdquo; said Orde dully. His voice sounded to
      himself very far away. Suddenly the external world, too, seemed removed to
      a distance, far from his centre of consciousness. He felt himself moving
      in strange and distorted surroundings; he heard himself repeating to each
      of a number of wavering, gigantic figures the talismanic words that had
      accomplished the dissolution of the earth for himself: &ldquo;They've opened the
      channel.&rdquo; At last he felt hard planks beneath his feet, and, shaking his
      head with an effort, he made out the pilot-house of the SPRITE and a
      hollow-eyed man leaning against it. &ldquo;They've opened the channel, Marsh,&rdquo;
       he repeated. &ldquo;I guess that'll be all.&rdquo; Then quite slowly he sank to the
      deck, sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Welton, returning from his labours with the iron bridge and the jam, found
      them thus. Men slept on the deck of the tug, aboard the pile-driver. Two
      or three had even curled up in the crevices of the jam, resting in the
      arms of the monster they had subdued.

    </h2>
    <p>
      When Newmark left, in the early stages of the jam, he gave scant thought
      to the errand on which he had ostensibly departed. Whether or nor Orde got
      a supply of piles was to him a matter of indifference. His hope, or rather
      preference was that the jam should go out; but he saw clearly what Orde,
      blinded by the swift action of the struggle, was as yet unable to
      perceive. Even should the riverman succeed in stopping the jam, the
      extraordinary expenses incidental to the defence and to the subsequent
      salvaging, untangling and sorting would more than eat up the profits of
      the drive. Orde would then be forced to ask for an extension of time on
      his notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving in Monrovia, he drove to his own house. To Mallock he issued
      orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the office and tell them I am ill,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and then hunt up Mr.
      Heinzman, wherever he is, and tell him I want to see him immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not trouble to send word directly to Orde, up river; but left him
      to be informed by the slow process of filtration through the bookkeepers.
      The interim of several hours before Heinzman appeared he spent very
      comfortably in his easy chair, dipping into a small volume of Montaigne.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the German was announced. He entered rather red and breathless,
      obviously surprised to find Newmark at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dot was a terrible jam,&rdquo; said he, mopping his brow and sinking into a
      chair. &ldquo;I got lots of logs in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark dismissed the subject with an abrupt flip of his unlighted cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heinzman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in three weeks at the latest Orde will come to you
      asking for a renewal of the notes you hold against our firm. You must
      refuse to make such a renewal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All righdt,&rdquo; agreed Heinzman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll probably offer you higher interest. You must refuse that. Then when
      the notes are overdue you must begin suit in foreclosure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All righdt,&rdquo; repeated Heinzman a little restlessly. &ldquo;Do you think he vill
      hold that jam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark shrugged his shoulders swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got lots of logs in that jam. If that jam goes out I vill lose a heap
      of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'll make quite a heap on this deal,&rdquo; said Newmark carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose he holds it,&rdquo; said Heinzman, pausing. &ldquo;I hate like the mischief
      to joomp on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; said Newmark decisively. &ldquo;That's what he's there for.&rdquo; He looked at
      the German sharply. &ldquo;I suppose you know just how deep you're in this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I ain't backing oudt,&rdquo; negatived Heinzman. &ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you know what to do,&rdquo; said Newmark, terminating the
      interview.

      XLIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Little by little the water went down. The pressure, already considerably
      relieved by the channel into Stearn's Bayou, slackened every hour. Orde,
      still half dazed with his long-delayed sleep, drove back along the marsh
      road to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      His faculties were still in the torpor that follows rest after exhaustion.
      The warm July sun, the breeze from the Lake, the flash of light from the
      roadside water, these were all he had room for among his perceptions. He
      was content to enjoy them, and to anticipate drowsily the keen pleasure of
      seeing Carroll again. In the rush of the jam he had heard nothing from
      her. For all he knew she and Bobby might have been among the spectators on
      the bank; he had hardly once left the river. It did not seem to him
      strange that Carroll should not have been there to welcome him after the
      struggle was over. Rarely did she get to the booms in ordinary
      circumstances. This episode of the big jam was, after all, nothing but
      part of the day's work to Orde; a crisis, exaggerated it is true, but like
      many other crises a man must meet and cope with on the river. There was no
      reason why Carroll should drive the twelve miles between Monrovia and the
      booms, unless curiosity should take her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the team left the marsh road for the county turnpike past the mills and
      lumberyards, Orde shook himself fully awake. He began to review the
      situation. As Newmark had accurately foreseen, he came almost immediately
      to a realisation that the firm would not be able to meet the notes given
      to Heinzman. Orde had depended on the profits from the season's drive to
      enable him to make up the necessary amount. Those profits would be greatly
      diminished, if not wiped out entirely, by the expenses, both regular and
      irregular, incurred in holding the jam; by the damage suits surely to be
      brought by the owners of the piles, trees, pile-drivers and other supplies
      and materials requisitioned in the heat of the campaign; and by the extra
      labour necessary to break out the jam and to sort the logs according to
      their various destinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to get an extension of time,&rdquo; said Orde to himself. &ldquo;Of course
      Joe will let me have more time on my own personal note to the firm. And
      Heinzman surely ought to&mdash;I saved a lot of his logs in that jam. And
      if he doesn't want to, I guess an offer of a little higher interest will
      fetch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily the state of affairs would have worried him, for it was exactly
      the situation he had fought against so hard. But now he was too wearied in
      soul and body. He dismissed the subject from his mind. The horses, left
      almost to themselves, lapsed into a sleepy jog. After a little they passed
      the bridge and entered the town. Warm spicy odours of pine disengaged
      themselves from the broken shingles and sawdust of the roadway, and
      floated upward through the hot sunshine. The beautiful maples with their
      dense shadows threw the sidewalks into coolness. Up one street and down
      another the horses took their accustomed way. Finally they pulled up
      opposite the Orde house. Orde hitched the horses, and, his step quickening
      in anticipation, sprang up the walk and into the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, sweetheart!&rdquo; he called cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The echoes alone answered him. He cried again, and yet again, with a
      growing feeling of disappointment that Carroll should happen to be from
      home. Finally a door opened and shut in the back part of the house. A
      moment later Mary, the Irish servant girl, came through the dining-room,
      caught sight of Orde, threw her apron over her head, and burst into one of
      those extravagant demonstrations of grief peculiar to the warm-hearted of
      her class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde stopped short, a sinking at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mary?&rdquo; he asked very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl only wept the louder, rocking back and forth in a fresh
      paroxysm of grief. Beside himself with anxiety Orde sprang forward to
      shake her by the arm, to shower her with questions. These elicited nothing
      but broken and incoherent fragments concerning &ldquo;the missus,&rdquo; &ldquo;oh, the sad
      day!&rdquo; &ldquo;and me lift all alone with Bobby, me heart that heavy,&rdquo; and the
      like, which served merely to increase Orde's bewilderment and anxiety. At
      this moment Bobby himself appeared from the direction of the kitchen.
      Orde, frantic with alarm, fell upon his son. Bobby, much bewildered by all
      this pother, could only mumble something about &ldquo;smallpox,&rdquo; and &ldquo;took mamma
      away with doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? where, Bobby?&rdquo; cried Orde, fairly shaking the small boy by the
      shoulder. He felt like a man in a bad dream, trying to reach a goal that
      constantly eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a calm, dry voice broke through the turmoil of questions
      and exclamations. Orde looked up to see the tall, angular form of Doctor
      McMullen standing in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; said the doctor in answer to Orde's agonised expression.
      &ldquo;Your wife was exposed to smallpox and is at my house to avoid the danger
      of spreading contagion. She is not ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having thus in one swift decisive sentence covered the ground of Orde's
      anxiety, he turned to the sniffling servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said he sternly, &ldquo;I'm ashamed of you! What kind of an exhibition
      is this? Go out to the kitchen and cook us some lunch!&rdquo; He watched her
      depart with a humourous quirk to his thin lips. &ldquo;Fool Irish!&rdquo; he said with
      a Scotchman's contempt. &ldquo;I meant to head you off before you got home, but
      I missed you. Come in and sit down, and I'll tell you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're quite sure Mrs. Orde is well?&rdquo; insisted Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely. Never better. As well as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was she exposed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down at Heinzman's. You know&mdash;or perhaps you don't&mdash;that old
      Heinzman is the worst sort of anti-vaccination crank. Well, he's reaped
      the reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he smallpox?&rdquo; asked Orde. &ldquo;Why, I thought I remembered seeing him up
      river only the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; his daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Lord knows where she got it. But get it she did. Mrs. Orde happened
      to be with her when she was taken with the fever and distressing symptoms
      that begin the disease. As a neighbourly deed she remained with the girl.
      Of course no one could tell it was smallpox at that time. Next day,
      however, the characteristic rash appeared on the thighs and armpits, and I
      diagnosed the case.&rdquo; Dr. McMullen laughed a little bitterly. &ldquo;Lord, you
      ought to have seen them run! Servants, neighbours, friends&mdash;they all
      skedaddled, and you couldn't have driven them back with a steam-roller! I
      telegraphed to Redding for a nurse. Until she came Mrs. Orde stayed by,
      like a brick. Don't know what I should have done without her. There was
      nobody to do anything at all. As soon as the nurse came Mrs. Orde gave up
      her post. I tell you,&rdquo; cried Doctor McMullen with as near an approach to
      enthusiasm as he ever permitted himself, &ldquo;there's a sensible woman! None
      of your story-book twaddle about nursing through the illness, and all
      that. When her usefulness was ended, she knew enough to step aside
      gracefully. There was not much danger as far as she was concerned. I had
      vaccinated her myself, you know, last year. But she MIGHT take the
      contagion and she wanted to spare the youngster. Quite right. So I offered
      her quarters with us for a couple of weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago was this?&rdquo; asked Orde, who had listened with a warm glow of
      pride to the doctor's succinct statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Mina getting on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll get well. It was a mild case. Fever never serious after the
      eruption appeared. I suppose I'll have old Heinzman on my hands, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why; has he taken it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but he will. Emotional old German fool. Rushed right in when he heard
      his daughter was sick. Couldn't keep him out. And he's been with her or
      near her ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think he's in for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure to be,&rdquo; replied Dr. McMullen. &ldquo;Unless a man has been vaccinated,
      continuous exposure means infection in the great majority of cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard luck,&rdquo; said Orde thoughtfully. &ldquo;I'm going to step up to your house
      and see Mrs. Orde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can telephone her,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;And you can see her if you want
      to. Only in that case I should advise your remaining away from Bobby until
      we see how things turn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he concluded with a sigh, after a moment's
      thought, &ldquo;I suppose I'd better stay by the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called up Dr. McMullen's house on the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's good to hear your voice again,&rdquo; cried Carroll, &ldquo;even if I can't
      see you! You must promise me right after lunch to walk up past the house
      so I can see you. I'll wave at you from the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a dear, brave girl, and I'm proud of you,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! There was no danger at all. I'd been vaccinated recently. And
      somebody had to take care of poor Mina until we could get help. How's
      Bobby?&rdquo;
     </p>

      XLIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      After lunch Orde went downtown to his office where for some time he sat
      idly looking over the mail. About three o'clock Newmark came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Joe,&rdquo; said Orde with a slight constraint, &ldquo;sorry to hear you've
      been under the weather. You don't look very sick now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm better,&rdquo; replied Newmark, briefly; &ldquo;this is my first appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad you got sick just at that time,&rdquo; said Orde; &ldquo;we needed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I hear. You may rest assured I'd have been there if possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; said Orde, heartily, his slight resentment dissipating, as
      always, in the presence of another's personality. &ldquo;Well, we had a lively
      time, you bet, all right; and got through about by the skin of our teeth.&rdquo;
       He arose and walked over to Newmark's desk, on the edge of which he
      perched. &ldquo;It's cost us considerable; and it's going to cost us a lot more,
      I'll have to get an extension on those notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked Newmark, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde picked up a paper knife and turned it slowly between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe I'll be able to meet those notes. So many things have
      happened&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; broke in Newmark, &ldquo;the firm certainly cannot do so. I've been
      relying on your assurance that you would take them up personally. Our
      resources are all tied up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't we raise anything more on the Northern Peninsula timber?&rdquo; asked
      Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know we can't,&rdquo; cried Newmark, with an appearance of growing
      excitement. &ldquo;The last seventy-five thousand we borrowed for me finishes
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you take up part of your note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My note comes due in 1885,&rdquo; rejoined Newmark with cold disgust. &ldquo;I expect
      to take it up then. But I can't until then. I hadn't expected anything
      like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't get hot,&rdquo; said Orde vaguely. &ldquo;I only thought that Northern
      Peninsula stuff might be worth saving any way we could figure it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth saving!&rdquo; snorted Newmark, whirling in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, keep your hair on,&rdquo; said Orde, on whom Newmark's manner was
      beginning to have its effect, as Newmark intended it should. &ldquo;You have my
      Boom Company stock as security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty security for the loss of a tract like the Upper Peninsula timber!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's the security you asked for, and suggested,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you'd surely be able to pay it,&rdquo; retorted Newmark, now secure
      in the position he desired to take, that of putting Orde entirely in the
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I expected to pay it; and I'll pay it yet,&rdquo; rejoined Orde. &ldquo;I don't
      think Heinzman will stand in his own light rather than renew the notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized his hat and departed. Once in the street, however, his
      irritation passed. As was the habit of the man, he began more clearly to
      see Newmark's side, and so more emphatically to blame himself. After all,
      when he got right down to the essentials, he could not but acknowledge
      that Newmark's anger was justified. For his own private ends he had
      jeopardised the firm's property. More of a business man might have
      reflected that Newmark, as financial head, should have protected the firm
      against all contingencies; should have seen to it that it met Heinzman's
      notes, instead of tying up its resources in unnecessary ways. Orde's own
      delinquency bulked too large in his eyes to admit his perception of this.
      By the time he had reached Heinzman's office, the last of his irritation
      had vanished. Only he realised clearly now that it would hardly do to ask
      Newmark for a renewal of the personal note on which depended his retention
      of his Boom Company stock unless he could renew the Heinzman note also.
      This is probably what Newmark intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Heinzman?&rdquo; he asked briefly of the first clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Heinzman is at home ill,&rdquo; replied the bookkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already?&rdquo; said Orde. He drummed on the black walnut rail thoughtfully.
      The notes came due in ten days. &ldquo;How bad is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk looked up curiously. &ldquo;Can't say. Probably won't be back for a
      long time. It's smallpox, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Orde. &ldquo;Well, who's in charge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lambert. You'll find him in the private office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde passed through the grill into the inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Lambert,&rdquo; he addressed the individual seated at Heinzman's desk.
      &ldquo;So you're the boss, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lambert turned, showing a perfectly round face, ornamented by a dot of a
      nose, two dots of eyes set rather close together, and a pursed up mouth.
      His skin was very brown and shiny, and was so filled by the flesh beneath
      as to take the appearance of having been inflated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm the boss,&rdquo; said he non-committally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde dropped into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heinzman holds some notes due against our people in ten days,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;I came in to see about their renewal. Can you attend to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can attend to it,&rdquo; replied Lambert. He struck a bell; and to the
      bookkeeper who answered he said: &ldquo;John, bring me those Newmark and Orde
      papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde heard the clang of the safe door. In a moment the clerk returned and
      handed to Lambert a long manilla envelope. Lambert opened this quite
      deliberately, spread its contents on his knee, and assumed a pair of round
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Note for seventy-five thousand dollars with interest at ten per cent.
      Interest paid to January tenth. Mortgage deed on certain lands described
      herein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lambert looked up over his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to renew the note for another year,&rdquo; Orde explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't do it,&rdquo; replied Lambert, removing and folding the glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Heinzman gave me especial instructions in regard to this matter just
      before his daughter was taken sick. He told me if you came when he was not
      here&mdash;he intended to go to Chicago yesterday&mdash;to tell you he
      would not renew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Orde blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'll give him twelve per cent for another year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said not to renew, even if you offered higher interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you happen to know whether he intends anything in regard to this
      mortgage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He instructed me to begin suit in foreclosure immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand this,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lambert shook his head blandly. Orde thought for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's your telephone?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried in vain to get Heinzman at his house. Finally the telephone girl
      informed him that although messages had come from the stricken household,
      she had been unable to get an answer to any of her numerous calls, and
      suspected the bell had been removed. Finally Orde left the office at a
      loss how to proceed next. Lambert, secretly overjoyed at this opportunity
      of exercising an unaccustomed and autocratic power, refused to see beyond
      his instructions. Heinzman's attitude puzzled Orde. A foreclosure could
      gain Heinzman no advantage of immediate cash. Orde was forced to the
      conclusion that the German saw here a good opportunity to acquire cheap a
      valuable property. In that case a personal appeal would avail little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde tramped out to the end of the pier and back, mulling over the tangled
      problem. He was pressed on all sides&mdash;by the fatigue after his
      tremendous exertions of the past two weeks; by his natural uneasiness in
      regard to Carroll; and finally by this new complication which threatened
      the very basis of his prosperity. Nevertheless the natural optimism of the
      man finally won its ascendency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the year of redemption on that mortgage,&rdquo; he reminded himself.
      &ldquo;We may be able to do something in that time. I don't know just what,&rdquo; he
      added whimsically, with a laugh at himself. He became grave. &ldquo;Poor Joe,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;this is pretty tough on him. I'll have to make it up to him
      somehow. I can let him in on that California deal, when the titles are
      straightened out.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XLV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde did not return to the office; he felt unwilling to face Newmark until
      he had a little more thoroughly digested the situation. He spent the rest
      of the afternoon about the place, picking up the tool house, playing with
      Bobby, training Duke, the black and white setter dog. Three or four times
      he called up Carroll by telephone; and three or four times he passed Dr.
      McMullen's house to shout his half of a long-distance and fragmentary
      conversation with her. He ate solemnly with Bobby at six o'clock, the two
      quite subdued over the vacant chair at the other end of the table. After
      dinner they sat on the porch until Bobby's bed-time. Orde put his small
      son to bed, and sat talking with the youngster as long as his conscience
      would permit. Then he retired to the library, where, for a long time, he
      sat in twilight and loneliness. Finally, when he could no longer
      distinguish objects across the room, he arose with a sigh, lit the lamp,
      and settled himself to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of the twilight drained from the world, and the window panes
      turned a burnished black. Through the half-open sashes sucked a warm
      little breeze, swaying the long lace curtains back and forth. The hum of
      lawn-sprinklers and the chirping of crickets and tree-frogs came with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the lawn-sprinklers fell silent. Gradually there descended upon
      the world the deep slumbrous stillness of late night; a stillness
      compounded of a thousand and one mysterious little noises repeated
      monotonously over and over until their identity was lost in
      accustomedness. Occasionally the creak of timbers or the sharp scurrying
      of a mouse in the wall served more to accentuate than to break this night
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde sat lost in reverie, his book in his lap. At stated intervals the
      student lamp at his elbow flared slightly, then burned clear again after a
      swallow of satisfaction in its reservoir. These regular replenishments of
      the oil supply alone marked the flight of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Orde leaned forward, his senses at the keenest attention. After a
      moment he arose and quietly walked toward the open window. Just as he
      reached the casement and looked out, a man looked in. The two stared at
      each other not two feet apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! Heinzman!&rdquo; cried Orde in a guarded voice. He stepped
      decisively through the window, seized the German by the arm, and drew him
      one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman was trembling violently as though from a chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dake me somewheres,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;Somewheres quick. I haf
      broke quarantine, and dey vill be after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The place for you is at your own house,&rdquo; said Orde, his anger rising.
      &ldquo;What do you mean by coming here and exposing my house to infection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman began to blubber; choked, shivered all over, and cried aloud with
      an expression of the greatest agony:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must dake me somewheres. I must talk with you and your goot wife. I
      haf somedings to say to you.&rdquo; He in his turn grasped Orde by the arm. &ldquo;I
      haf broke quarantine to gome and tell you. Dey are dere mit shotguns to
      kill me if I broke quarantine. And I haf left my daughter, my daughter
      Mina, all alone mit dose people to come and tell you. And now you don't
      listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrung his hands dramatically, his soft pudgy body shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said Orde briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way around the house to the tool shed. Here he lit a lantern,
      thrust forward one nail keg, and sat down on another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman sat down on the nail keg, almost immediately arose, walked up and
      down two or three times, and resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked at him curiously. He was half dressed, without a collar, his
      thin hair unkempt. The usual bright colour of his cheeks had become livid,
      and the flesh, ordinarily firm and elastic, had fallen in folds and
      wrinkles. His eyes burned bright as though from some internal fire. A
      great restlessness possessed him. Impulsively Orde leaned forward to touch
      his hand. It was dry and hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Heinzman?&rdquo; he asked quietly, fully prepared for the vagaries
      of a half delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach, Orde!&rdquo; cried the German, &ldquo;I am tortured mit HOLLENQUALLE&mdash;what
      you call?&mdash;hell's fire. You, whose wife comes in and saves my Mina
      when the others runs away. You, my best friends! It is SCHRECKLICH! She
      vas the noblest, the best, the most kindest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean Mrs. Orde's staying with Mina,&rdquo; broke in Orde, &ldquo;it was only
      what any one should have done, in humanity; and I, for one, am only too
      glad she had the chance. You mustn't exaggerate. And now you'd better get
      home where you can be taken care of. You're sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my friend,&rdquo; said Heinzman, vigourously shaking his head. &ldquo;She
      might take the disease. She might die. It vas noble.&rdquo; He shuddered. &ldquo;My
      Mina left to die all alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde rose to his feet with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Carroll was glad of the chance. Now let me
      get you home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Heinzman's excitement had suddenly died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, extending his trembling hand; &ldquo;sit down. I want to talk
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in no condition to talk business,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Heinzman with unexpected vigour. &ldquo;Sit down! Listen to me!
      Dot's better. I haf your note for sefenty-five t'ousand dollars. No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dot money I never lent you. NO! I'm not crazy. Sit still! I know my name
      is on dot note. But the money came from somewheres else. It came from your
      partner, Joseph Newmark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde half rose from his keg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What?&rdquo; he asked in bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Den ven you could not pay the note, I vas to foreclose and hand over dot
      Northern Peninsula land to Joseph Newmark, your partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vas to get a share. It vas a trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Orde grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dere is no go on. Dot is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you come to tell me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because for more than one year now I say to mineself, 'Carl Heinzman, you
      vas one dirty scoundrel. You vas dishonest; a sneak; a thief'; I don't
      like to call myself names like dose. It iss all righdt to be smart; but to
      be a thief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you pull out?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't!&rdquo; cried Heinzman piteously. &ldquo;How could I? He haf me cold. I
      paid Stanford five hundred dollars for his vote on the charter; and Joseph
      Newmark, he know dot; he can PROVE it. He tell me if I don't do what he
      say, he put me in jail. Think of dot! All my friends go back on me; all my
      money gone; maybe my daughter Mina go back on me, too. How could I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he can still put you in prison,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vot I care?&rdquo; cried Heinzman, throwing up both his arms. &ldquo;You and your
      wife are my friends. She save my Mina. DU LIEBER GOTT! If my daughter had
      died, vot good iss friends and money? Vot good iss anything? I don't vant
      to live! And ven I sit dere by her always something ask me: 'Vy you do dot
      to the peoples dot safe your Mina?' And ven she look at me, her eyes say
      it; and in the night everything cry out at me; and I get sick, and I can't
      stand it no longer, and I don't care if he send me to prison or to hell,
      no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His excitement died. He sat listless, his eyes vacant, his hands between
      his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, I go,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you that note?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph Newmark, he keeps it most times,&rdquo; replied Heinzman, &ldquo;but now it is
      at my office for the foreclosure. I vill not foreclose; he can send me to
      the penitentiary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telephone Lambert in the morning to give it to me. No; here. Write an
      order in this notebook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heinzman wrote the required order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go,&rdquo; said he, suddenly weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde accompanied him down the street. The German was again light-headed
      with the fever, mumbling about his daughter, the notes, Carroll, the
      voices that had driven him to righteousness. By some manoeuvring Orde
      succeeded in slipping him through the improvised quarantine without
      discovery. Then the riverman with slow and thoughtful steps returned to
      where the lamp in the study still marked off with the spaced
      replenishments from its oil reservoir the early morning hours.

    <h2>
      XLVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Morning found Orde still seated in the library chair. His head was sunk
      forward on his chest; his hands were extended listless, palms up, along
      the arms of the chair; his eyes were vacant and troubled. Hardly once in
      the long hours had he shifted by a hair's breadth his position. His body
      was suspended in an absolute inaction while his spirit battered at the
      walls of an impasse. For, strangely enough, Orde did not once, even for a
      single instant, give a thought to the business aspects of the situation&mdash;what
      it meant to him and his prospects or what he could do about it. Hurt to
      the soul he stared at the wreck of a friendship. Nothing will more deeply
      sicken the heart of a naturally loyal man than to discover baseless his
      faith in some one he has thoroughly trusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde had liked Newmark. He had admired heartily his clearness of vision,
      his financial skill, his knowledge of business intricacies, his
      imperturbable coolness, all the abilities that had brought him to success.
      With a man of Orde's temperament, to admire is to like; and to like is to
      invest with all good qualities. He had constructed his ideal of a friend,
      with Newmark as a basis; and now that this, which had seemed to him as
      solid a reality as a brick block, had dissolved into nothing, he found
      himself in the necessity of refashioning his whole world. He was not angry
      at Newmark. But he was grieved down to the depths of his being.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the full sun shone into the library, he aroused himself to change his
      clothes. Then, carrying those he had just discarded, he slipped out of the
      house and down the street. Duke, the black and white setter dog, begged to
      follow him. Orde welcomed the animal's company. He paused only long enough
      to telephone from the office telling Carroll he would be out of town all
      day. Then he set out at a long swinging gait over the hills. By the time
      the sun grew hot, he was some miles from the village and in the high beech
      woods. There he sat down, his back to a monster tree. All day long he
      gazed steadily on the shifting shadows and splotches of sunlight; on the
      patches of blue sky, the dazzling white clouds that sailed across them; on
      the waving, whispering frond that over-arched him, and the deep cool
      shadows beneath. The woods creatures soon became accustomed to his
      presence. Squirrels of the several varieties that abounded in the Michigan
      forests scampered madly after each other in spirals around the tree
      trunks, or bounded across the ground in long undulating leaps. Birds
      flashed and called and disappeared mysteriously. A chewink, brave in his
      black and white and tan uniform, scratched mightily with great two-footed
      swoops that threw the vegetable mould over Orde's very feet. Blazoned
      butterflies&mdash;the yellow and black turnus, the dark troilus, the
      shade-loving nymphalis&mdash;flickered in and out of the patches of
      sunlight. Orde paid them no attention. The noon heat poured down through
      the forest isles like an incense. Overhead swung the sun, and down the
      slope until the long shafts of its light lifted wand-like across the tree
      trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this hint of evening Orde shook himself and arose. He was little nearer
      the readjustment he sought than he had been the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached home a little before six o'clock. To his surprise he found
      Taylor awaiting him. The lawyer had written nothing as to his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had things pretty well in shape,&rdquo; he said, after the first greetings
      had been exchanged, &ldquo;and it would do no good to stay away any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the trouble is over?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't say that,&rdquo; replied Taylor; &ldquo;but you can rest easy as to the
      title to your lands. The investigation had no real basis to it. There may
      have been some small individual cases of false entry; but nothing on which
      to ground a real attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When can I borrow on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a year or two, I should say. There's an awful lot of red-tape to
      unwind, as there always is in such cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Orde in some disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taylor hesitated, removed his eye-glasses, wiped them carefully, and
      replaced them. He glanced at Orde sidelong through his keen, shrewd eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something more to tell you; something that will be painful,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde looked up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; what is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The general cussedness of all this investigation business had me puzzled,
      until at last I made up my mind to do a little investigating on my own
      account. It all looked foolish to me. Somebody or something must be back
      of all this performance. I was at it all the time I was West, between
      times on regular business, of course. I didn't make much out of my direct
      efforts&mdash;they cover things up well in those matters&mdash;but at last
      I got on a clue by sheer accident. There was one man behind all this. He
      was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe Newmark,&rdquo; said Orde quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; cried Taylor in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know, Frank; I just guessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you made a good guess. It was Newmark. He'd tied up the land in
      this trumped-up investigation so you could not borrow on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he find out I owned any land?&rdquo; asked Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I couldn't tell you. Must have been a leak somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite likely,&rdquo; said Orde calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taylor looked at his principal in some wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must say you take it coolly enough,&rdquo; said he at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; went on Taylor after a moment, &ldquo;we have a strong presumption
      of conspiracy to get hold of your Boom Company stock, which I believe you
      put up as security. But I don't see how we have any incontestable proof of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proof? What more do we want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd have no witness to any of these transactions; nor have we
      documentary proofs. It's merely moral certainty; and moral certainty isn't
      much in a court of law. I'll see him, if you say so, though, and scare him
      into some sort of an arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he decidedly. &ldquo;Rather not. I'll run this. Please say nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; interjected Taylor, a trifle indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll figure out what I want to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde pressed Taylor to stay to supper; but the latter declined. After a
      few moments' conversation on general topics the lawyer took his departure,
      secretly marvelling over the phlegmatic way in which Orde had taken what
      had been to Taylor, when he first stumbled against it, a shocking piece of
      news.

    <h2>
      XLVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Orde did not wish to return to the office until he had worked his problem
      out; so, to lend his absence the colour of naturalness, he drove back next
      morning to the booms. There he found enough to keep him occupied all that
      day and the next. As in those times the long distance telephone had not
      yet been attempted, he was cut off from casual communication with the
      village. Late in the afternoon he returned home.
    </p>
    <p>
      A telephone to Carroll apprised him that all was well with her. A few
      moments later the call sounded, and Orde took a message that caused him to
      look grave and to whistle gently with surprise. He ate supper with Bobby.
      About star-time he took his hat and walked slowly down the street beneath
      the velvet darkness of the maples. At Newmark's he turned in between the
      oleanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mallock answered his ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, Mr. Newmark is out, sir,&rdquo; said Mallock. &ldquo;I'll tell him you
      called, sir,&rdquo; and started respectfully but firmly to close the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Orde thrust his foot and knee in the opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come in and wait,&rdquo; said he quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, this way, sir,&rdquo; said Mallock, trying to indicate the
      dining-room, where he wished Orde to sit until he could come at his
      master's wishes in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde caught the aroma of tobacco and the glimmer of light to the left.
      Without reply he turned the knob of the door and entered the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he found Newmark in evening dress, seated in a low easy chair
      beneath a lamp, smoking, and reading a magazine. At Orde's appearance in
      the doorway, he looked up calmly, his paper knife poised, keeping the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you, Orde,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your man told me you were not in,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was mistaken. Won't you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde entered the room and mechanically obeyed Newmark's suggestion, his
      manner preoccupied. For some time he stared with wrinkled brow at a point
      above the illumination of the lamp. Newmark, over the end of his cigar,
      poised a foot from his lips, watched the riverman with a cool calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newmark,&rdquo; Orde began abruptly at last, &ldquo;I know all about this deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What deal?&rdquo; asked Newmark, after a barely perceptible pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This arrangement you made with Heinzman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I borrowed some money from Heinzman for the firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and you supplied that money yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark's eyes narrowed, but he said nothing. Orde glanced toward him,
      then away again, as though ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Newmark at last, &ldquo;what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had the money to lend why didn't you lend it direct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it looks better to mortgage to an outside holder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An expression of profound disgust flitted across Orde's countenance.
      Newmark smiled covertly, and puffed once or twice strongly on his nearly
      extinct cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not the reason,&rdquo; went on Orde. &ldquo;You agreed with Heinzman to
      divide when you succeeded in foreclosing me out of the timber lands given
      as security. Furthermore you instructed Floyd to go out on the eve of that
      blow in spite of his warnings; and you contracted with McLeod for the new
      vessels; and you've tied us up right and left for the sole purpose of
      pinching us down where we couldn't meet those notes. That's the only
      reason you borrowed the seventy-five thousand on your own account; so we
      couldn't borrow it to save ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me you are interesting but inconclusive,&rdquo; said Newmark, as
      Orde paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sort of thing is somewhat of a facer,&rdquo; went on Orde without the
      slightest attention to the interjection. &ldquo;It took me some days to work it
      out in all its details; but I believe I understand it all now. I don't
      quite understand how you discovered about my California timber. That
      'investigation' was a very pretty move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the devil did you get onto that?&rdquo; cried Newmark, startled for a
      moment out of his cool attitude of cynical aloofness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you acknowledge it?&rdquo; shot in Orde quick as a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark laughed in amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't I? Of course Heinzman blabbed. You couldn't have got it all
      anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde arose to his feet, and half sat again on the arm of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I'll tell you what we will do in this matter,&rdquo; said he crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Newmark unexpectedly took the aggressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll follow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the original programme, as laid down by myself.
      I'm tired of dealing with blundering fools. Heinzman's mortgage will be
      foreclosed; and you will hand over as per the agreement your Boom Company
      stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde stared at him in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say you have good nerve,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you don't seem to realise that
      you are pretty well tangled up. I don't know what they call it: criminal
      conspiracy, or something of that sort, I suppose. So far from handing over
      to you the bulk of my property, I can send you to the penitentiary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; rejoined Newmark, leaning forward in his turn. &ldquo;I know you too
      well, Jack Orde. You're a fool of more kinds than I care to count, and
      this is one of the kinds. Do you seriously mean to say that you dare try
      to prosecute me? Just as sure as you do, I'll put Heinzman in the pen too.
      I've got it on him, COLD. He's a bribe giver&mdash;and somewhat of a
      criminal conspirator himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark leaned back with an amused little chuckle. &ldquo;If the man hadn't come
      to you and given the whole show away, you'd have lost every cent you
      owned. He did you the biggest favour in his power. And for your benefit
      I'll tell you what you can easily substantiate; I forced him into this
      deal with me. I had this bribery case on him; and in addition his own
      affairs were all tied up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that,&rdquo; replied Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had the man to gain by telling you?&rdquo; pursued Newmark. &ldquo;Nothing at
      all. What had he to lose? Everything: his property, his social position,
      his daughter's esteem, which the old fool holds higher than any of them.
      You could put me in the pen, perhaps&mdash;with Heinzman's testimony. But
      the minute Heinzman appears on the stand, I'll land him high and dry and
      gasping, without a chance to flop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment to puff at his cigar. Finding it had gone out, he laid
      the butt carefully on the ash tray at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not much used to giving advice,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;least of all when it is
      at all likely to be taken. But I'll offer you some. Throw Heinzman over.
      Let him go to the pen. He's been crooked, and a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what you'd do, I suppose,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly that. You owe nothing to Heinzman; but something to what you
      would probably call repentance, but which is in reality a mawkish
      sentimentality of weakness. However, I know you, Jack Orde, from top to
      bottom; and I know you're fool enough not to do it. I'm so sure of it that
      I dare put it to you straight; you could never bring yourself to the point
      of destroying a man who had sacrificed himself for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have this game all figured out,&rdquo; said Orde with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark leaned back in his chair. Two bright red spots burned in his
      ordinarily sallow cheeks. He half closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right,&rdquo; said he with an ill-concealed satisfaction. &ldquo;If you play a
      game, play it through. Each man is different; for each a different
      treatment is required. The game is infinite, wonderful, fascinating to the
      skilful.&rdquo; He opened his eyes and looked over at Orde with a mild
      curiosity. &ldquo;I suppose men are about all of one kind to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two,&rdquo; said Orde grimly; &ldquo;the honest men and the scoundrels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;let's settle this thing. The fact remains that
      the firm owes a note to Heinzman, which it cannot pay. You owe a note to
      the firm which you cannot pay. All this may be slightly irregular; but for
      private reasons you do not care to make public the irregularity. Am I
      right so far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde, who had been watching him with a slightly sardonic smile, nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what I want out of this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might hear the other side,&rdquo; interrupted Orde. &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo;
       said he, producing a bundle of papers, &ldquo;I have the note and the mortgage
      in my possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whence Heinzman will shortly rescue them, as soon as I get to see him,&rdquo;
       countered Newmark. &ldquo;You acknowledge that I can force Heinzman; and you can
      hardly refuse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you force Heinzman, he'll land you,&rdquo; Orde pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Canada for me, with no extradition. He travels with heavier
      baggage. I have the better trumps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd lose everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; smiled Newmark. &ldquo;And, as usual, you are forgetting the
      personal equation. Heinzman is&mdash;Heinzman. And I am I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose this affidavit from Heinzman as to the details of all this
      is useless for the same reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark's thin lips parted in another smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're ready to compromise below the face of the note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;because I know you well enough to realise that
      there is a point where your loyalty to Heinzman would step aside in favour
      of your loyalty to your family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think you know where that point is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the basis of my compromise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde began softly to laugh. &ldquo;Newmark, you're as clever as the devil,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;But aren't you afraid to lay out your cards this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with you,&rdquo; replied Newmark, boldly; &ldquo;with anybody else on earth, yes.
      With you, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde continued to laugh, still in the low undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst of it is, I believe you're right,&rdquo; said he at last. &ldquo;You have
      the thing sized up; and there isn't a flaw in your reasoning. I always
      said that you were the brains of this concern. If it were not for one
      thing, I'd compromise sure; and that one thing was beyond your power to
      foresee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused. Newmark's eyes half-closed again, in a quick darting effort of
      his brain to run back over all the elements of the game he was playing.
      Orde waited in patience for him to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Newmark at last. &ldquo;Heinzman died of smallpox at four
      o'clock this afternoon,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XLVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Newmark did not alter his attitude nor his expression, but his face slowly
      went gray. For a full minute he sat absolutely motionless, his breath
      coming and going noisily through his contracted nostrils. Then he arose
      gropingly to his feet, and started toward one of the two doors leading
      from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Orde quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark steadied himself with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to get myself a drink in my bedroom,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Any
      objections?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;None. After you get your drink, come back. I want to
      talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark snarled at him: &ldquo;You needn't be afraid I'll run away. How'd I get
      out of town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it wouldn't pay you to run away,&rdquo; said Orde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newmark passed out through the door. Orde looked thoughtfully at
      Heinzman's affidavit, which, duly disinfected, had been handed him by Dr.
      McMullen as important; and thrust it and the other papers into his inside
      pocket. Then he arose to his feet and glided softly across the room to
      take a position close to the door through which Newmark had departed in
      quest of his drink. For a half minute he waited. Finally the door swung
      briskly inward. Like a panther, as quickly and as noiselessly, Orde sprang
      forward. A short but decisive struggle ensued. In less than ten seconds
      Orde had pinioned Newmark's arms to his side where he held them immovable
      with one of his own. The other hand he ran down Newmark's right arm to the
      pocket. There followed an instant of silent resistance. Then with a sharp
      cry of mingled anger and pain Newmark snatched his hand out and gazed a
      trifle amazedly at the half crushed fingers. Orde drew forth the revolver
      Newmark had grasped concealed in the coat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without hesitation he closed and locked the bedroom door; turned the key
      in the lock of the other; tried and fastened the window. The revolver he
      opened; spilled out the cartridges into his hand; and then tossed the
      empty weapon to Newmark, who had sunk into the chair by the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's your plaything,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;So you wanted that affidavit, did you?
      Now we have the place to ourselves; and we'll thresh this matter out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, collecting his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't need to tell you that I've got you about where you live,&rdquo; said he
      finally. &ldquo;Nor what I think of you. The case is open and shut; and I can
      send you over the road for the best part of your natural days. Also I've
      got these notes and the mortgage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit it,&rdquo; growled Newmark, &ldquo;you've got me. Send me up; and be damned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the question,&rdquo; went on Orde slowly. &ldquo;I've been at it three days,
      without much time off for sleep. You hurt me pretty bad, Joe. I trusted
      you; and I thought of you as a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark stirred slightly with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a hard time getting over that part of it; and about three-quarters
      of what was left in the world looked mighty like ashes for awhile. Then I
      began to see this thing a little clearer. We've been together a good many
      years now; and as near as I can make out you've been straight as a string
      with me for eight of them. Then I suppose the chance came and before you
      knew it you were in over your neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked, half-pleading toward Newmark. Newmark made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that's the way it might be. A man thinks he's mighty brave; and so
      he is, as long as he can see what's coming, and get ready for it. But some
      day an emergency just comes up and touches him on the shoulder, and he
      turns around and sees it all of a sudden. Then he finds he's a coward.
      It's pretty hard for me to understand dishonesty, or how a man can be
      dishonest. I've tried, but I can't do it. Crookedness isn't my particular
      kind of fault. But I do know this: that we every one of us have something
      to be forgiven for by some one. I guess I've got a temper that makes me
      pretty sorry sometimes. Probably you don't see how it's possible for a man
      to get crazy mad about little things. That isn't your particular kind of
      fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for God's sake, drop that preaching. It makes me sick!&rdquo; broke out
      Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde smiled whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not preaching,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and even if I were, I've paid a good many
      thousands of dollars, it seems, to buy the right to say what I damn
      please. And if you think I'm working up to a Christian forgiveness racket,
      you're very much mistaken. I'm not. I don't forgive you; and I surely
      despise your sort. But I'm explaining to you&mdash;no, to myself&mdash;just
      what I've been at for three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, turn me over to your sheriff, and let's get through with this,&rdquo;
       said Newmark sullenly. &ldquo;I suppose you've got that part of it all fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Newmark, that's just what I've been coming to, just what I've
      had such a hard time to get hold of. I felt it, but I couldn't put my
      finger on it. Now I know. I'm not going to hand you over to any sheriff;
      I'm going to let you off. No,&rdquo; he continued, in response to Newmark's look
      of incredulous amazement, &ldquo;it isn't from any fool notion of forgiveness. I
      told you I didn't forgive you. But I'm not going to burden my future life
      with you. That's just plain, ordinary selfishness. I suppose I really
      ought to jug you; but if I do, I'll always carry with me the thought that
      I've taken it on myself to judge a man. And I don't believe any man is
      competent to judge another. I told you why&mdash;or tried to&mdash;a
      minute or so ago. I've lived clean, and I've enjoyed the world as a clean
      open-air sort of proposition&mdash;like a windy day&mdash;and I always
      hope to. I'd rather drop this whole matter. In a short time I'd forget
      you; you'd pass out of my life entirely. But if we carry this thing
      through to a finish, I'd always have the thought with me that I'd put you
      in the pen; that you are there now. I don't like the notion. I'd rather
      finish this up right here and now and get it over and done with and take a
      fresh start.&rdquo; He paused and wiped his brow, wet with the unusual exertion
      of this self-analysis. &ldquo;I think a fellow ought to act always as if he was
      making the world. He ought to try not to put things in it that are going
      to make it an unpleasant or an evil world. We don't always do it; but we
      ought to try. Now if I were making a world, I wouldn't put a man in a
      penitentiary in it. Of course there's dangerous criminals.&rdquo; He glanced at
      Newmark a little anxiously. &ldquo;I don't believe you're that. You're sharp and
      dishonest, and need punishment; but you don't need extinction. Anyway, I'm
      not going to bother my future with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newmark, who had listened to this long and rambling exposition with
      increasing curiosity and interest, broke into a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've convicted me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm a most awful failure. I thought I
      knew you; but this passes all belief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orde brushed this speech aside as irrelevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our association, of course, comes to an end. There remain the terms of
      settlement. I could fire you out of this without a cent, and you'd have to
      git. But that wouldn't be fair. I don't give a damn for you; but it
      wouldn't be fair to me. Now as for the Northern Peninsula timber, you have
      had seventy-five thousand out of that and have lent me the same amount.
      Call that quits. I will take up your note when it comes due; and destroy
      the one given to Heinzman. For all your holdings in our common business I
      will give you my note without interest and without time for one hundred
      thousand dollars. That is not its face value, nor anything like it, but
      you have caused me directly and indirectly considerable loss. I don't know
      how soon I can pay this note; but it will be paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that satisfy you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's got to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I have the papers here all made out. They need simply to be
      signed and witnessed. Timbull is the nearest notary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked the outside door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence the two walked the block and a half to the notary's house. Here
      they were forced to wait some time while Timbull dressed himself and
      called the necessary witnesses. Finally the papers were executed. In the
      street Newmark paused significantly. But Orde did not take the hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming with me?&rdquo; asked Newmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Orde. &ldquo;There is one thing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In silence once more they returned to the shadowy low library filled with
      its evidences of good taste. Newmark threw himself into the armchair. He
      was quite recovered, once again the imperturbable, coldly calculating,
      cynical observer. Orde relocked the door, and turned to face him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have five days to leave town,&rdquo; he said crisply. &ldquo;Don't ever show up
      here again. Let me have your address for the payment of this note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took two steps forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've let you off from the pen because I didn't want my life bothered with
      the thought of you. But you've treated me like a hound. I've been loyal to
      the firm's interests from the start; and I've done my best by it. You
      knifed me in the back. You're a dirty, low-lived skunk. If you think
      you're going to get off scot-free, you're mightily mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He advanced two steps more. Newmark half arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked in some alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that I'm going to give you about the worst licking you ever heard
      TELL of,&rdquo; replied Orde, buttoning his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0049" id="link2H_4_0049">
      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>

    </div>
    <h2>
      XLIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Five minutes later Orde emerged from Newmark's house, softly rubbing the
      palm of one hand over the knuckles of the other. At the front gate he
      paused to look up at the stars. Then he shut it decisively behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up through the maple shaded streets he walked at a brisk pace, breathing
      deep, unconsciously squaring back his shoulders. The incident was behind
      him. In his characteristic decisive manner he had wiped the whole
      disagreeable affair off the slate. The copartnership with its gains and
      losses, its struggles and easy sailing was a thing of the past. Only there
      remained, as after a flood the sediment, a final result of it all, the
      balance between successes and failures, a ground beneath the feet of new
      aspirations. Orde had the Northern Peninsula timber; the Boom Company; and
      the carrying trade. They were all burdened with debt, it is true, but the
      riverman felt surging within him the reawakened and powerful energy for
      which optimism is another name. He saw stretching before him a long life
      of endeavour, the sort of endeavour he enjoyed, exulted in; and in it he
      would be untrammelled and alone. The idea appealed to him. Suddenly he was
      impatient for the morrow that he might begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned out of the side street. His own house lay before him, dark save
      for the gas jet in the hallway and the single lamp in the library. A
      harmony of softly touched chords breathed out through the open window. He
      stopped; then stole forward softly until he stood looking in through the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll sat leaning against the golden harp, her shining head with the
      soft shadows bent until it almost touched the strings. Her hands were
      straying idly over accustomed chords and rich modulations, the plaintive
      half-music of reverie. A soft light fell on her slender figure; half
      revealed the oval of her cheek and the sweep of her lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orde crept to her unheard. Gently he clasped her from behind. Unsurprised
      she relinquished the harp strings and sank back against his breast with a
      happy little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of fun being married, isn't it, sweetheart?&rdquo; he repeated their
      quaint formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of,&rdquo; she replied; and raised her face to his.
    </p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.E.9.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
